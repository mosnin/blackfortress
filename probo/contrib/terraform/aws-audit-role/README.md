# `getprobo/audit-role/aws`

Grants Probo read-only audit access to one AWS account through OIDC web
identity federation. Probo holds no credential for the account: it presents a
short-lived signed assertion that STS verifies against a public key set, and
you revoke access by deleting the role.

Parity with
[`../../cloudformation/aws-audit-role/aws-audit-role.yaml`](../../cloudformation/aws-audit-role/aws-audit-role.yaml),
for teams that would rather not run a stack they did not write.

## Usage

Copy the issuer URL and the subject out of the connector setup screen. AWS
compares the issuer URL case-sensitively and its last path segment is a
mixed-case identifier, so paste it rather than retyping it.

```hcl
module "probo_audit" {
  source = "getprobo/audit-role/aws"

  probo_issuer_url = "https://proboidentity.com/e5IaD7ibAAEAAAAAAZZ9aR_Oq_Npymhg"
  probo_subject    = "e5IaD7ibAAEAAAAAAZZ9aR_Oq_Npymhg"
  role_name        = "ProboAudit"
}

output "probo_role_arn" {
  value = module.probo_audit.role_arn
}
```

Give Probo the `role_arn` output when you create the connector.

## Verifying an install

Probo probes the install by assuming the role. Isolation is the
per-organization issuer: a foreign token fails at the provider-match step
before STS evaluates any trust-policy condition. The `sub` and `aud`
conditions in this module are IAM hygiene; Probo does not read them back.

## Covering a whole organization

This module covers **one account**. Organization-wide rollout is the caller's
responsibility, because how you reach your member accounts is yours to decide
and the module cannot guess it.

Probo currently reviews only the connected account. Apply the module in other
accounts now if you want those roles ready when org-wide coverage ships.

Use one provider alias per account with a role you already have there:

```hcl
module "probo_audit_member" {
  for_each = toset(var.member_account_ids)
  source   = "getprobo/audit-role/aws"

  providers = { aws = aws.member[each.key] }

  probo_issuer_url = var.probo_issuer_url
  probo_subject    = var.probo_subject
  role_name        = "ProboAudit"

  grant_organizations_read = false
}
```

`for_each` covers the accounts that exist when you apply. If you want accounts
added later to be onboarded without a second apply, use a service-managed
`aws_cloudformation_stack_set` with auto-deployment — which is what the
CloudFormation template does — or accept re-applying.

## What it creates

| Resource | Notes |
|---|---|
| `aws_iam_openid_connect_provider` | Skipped when `create_oidc_provider = false`. AWS allows one per issuer URL per account. |
| `aws_iam_role` | `ProboAudit` by default, `max_session_duration = 3600`. |
| `SecurityAudit`, `job-function/ViewOnlyAccess` | AWS-managed, read-only. |
| `ProboAuditIdentityRead` | IAM Identity Center reads the two managed policies miss. |
| `ProboAuditOrganizationsRead` | Only with `grant_organizations_read = true`. |

The trust policy pins both `aud` and `sub` with `StringEquals`. Isolation is
the per-organization issuer: a foreign token fails at the provider-match step
before STS evaluates any condition. Those pins are IAM hygiene; Probo does not
read them back.

## Inputs and outputs

Run `terraform-docs markdown .` for the generated table; the variable and output
descriptions in [`variables.tf`](variables.tf) and [`outputs.tf`](outputs.tf)
are the source of truth.

## Notes

- **The role must have the same name in every account.** Probo stores one role
  ARN per connector and reviews only that account today. Use the same name so
  the roles stay ready when org-wide coverage ships.
- **`thumbprint_list` is deliberately unset**, unlike the CloudFormation
  template which must supply a placeholder. AWS ignores it for publicly trusted
  certificates, so pinning one only produces a perpetual diff.
- Requires the `aws` provider at 5.0 or later, where `thumbprint_list` became
  optional.
