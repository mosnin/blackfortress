# `getprobo/audit-role/gcp`

Grants Probo read-only audit access to one GCP project through Workload
Identity Federation. Probo holds no credential for the project: it presents a
short-lived signed assertion that STS verifies against a public key set, and
you revoke access by deleting the pool or the service account.

This module covers **one project**. Apply it in the project you are
connecting. It does not walk folders or the organization.

## Usage

Copy the issuer URL and the subject out of the connector setup screen. GCP
compares the issuer URL case-sensitively and its last path segment is a
mixed-case identifier, so paste it rather than retyping it.

The Google provider must target the project you want to connect. Set
`project` on the provider, or export `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`.

Enable `iam.googleapis.com`, `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`,
`sts.googleapis.com`, `iamcredentials.googleapis.com`, and
`logging.googleapis.com` in that project before you apply. Terraform
uses the first two and Logging to grant the `_Required` view. Probo
uses STS and IAM Credentials to exchange a token and impersonate the
service account.

```hcl
module "probo_audit" {
  source = "getprobo/audit-role/gcp"

  probo_issuer_url     = "https://proboidentity.com/e5IaD7ibAAEAAAAAAZZ9aR_Oq_Npymhg"
  probo_subject        = "e5IaD7ibAAEAAAAAAZZ9aR_Oq_Npymhg"
  service_account_name = "probo-audit"
}

output "probo_workload_identity_provider" {
  value = module.probo_audit.workload_identity_provider
}

output "probo_service_account_email" {
  value = module.probo_audit.service_account_email
}
```

Give Probo the `workload_identity_provider` and `service_account_email`
outputs when you create the connector.

## Optional: MFA for human users

Human identities on the project are Google Workspace or Cloud Identity
users. Cloud IAM cannot grant Directory reads, so this module does not
cover MFA. After you apply, a Super Admin can assign a Users-read admin
role to the `probo-audit` service account in the Google Admin console
(Account > Admin roles > Assign service accounts). See [Assign a Google
Workspace administrator role to a service
account](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#assign_a_google_workspace_administrator_role_to_a_service_account).

Probo then reads 2-Step Verification enrollment with the same WIF token.
Skip this step if you do not need MFA on the GCP source; those accounts
stay MFA unknown.

## Verifying an install

Probo probes the install by exchanging a token and impersonating the service
account. Isolation is the per-organization issuer: a foreign token fails at
the provider-match step before GCP evaluates the attribute condition. The
`assertion.sub` condition in this module is IAM hygiene; Probo does not read
it back.

## What it creates

| Resource | Notes |
|---|---|
| `google_iam_workload_identity_pool` | `probo` by default. |
| `google_iam_workload_identity_pool_provider` | OIDC. Issuer is `probo_issuer_url`. `allowed_audiences` is unset. |
| `google_service_account` | `probo-audit` by default. |
| `roles/iam.securityReviewer` | Project IAM, additive. |
| `roles/iam.serviceAccountViewer` | Project IAM, additive. |
| `roles/logging.viewAccessor` | On `_Required`/`_AllLogs` only, additive. Admin Activity and the other `_Required` audit logs; not `_Default` application logs. |
| `roles/policyanalyzer.activityAnalysisViewer` | Project IAM, additive. |
| `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` | On the service account, for `principal://…/subject/{probo_subject}` only. |

The attribute condition pins `assertion.sub` with CEL `==`. Isolation is the
per-organization issuer: a foreign token fails at the provider-match step
before GCP evaluates the condition. That pin is IAM hygiene; Probo does not
read it back.

## Inputs and outputs

Run `terraform-docs markdown .` for the generated table. The variable and
output descriptions in [`variables.tf`](variables.tf) and
[`outputs.tf`](outputs.tf) are the source of truth.

## Notes

- **Do not set `allowed_audiences`.** An empty list tells GCP to accept the
  default provider URL, with or without the `https:` prefix. Probo mints that
  URL as the JWT `aud`.
- **The subject condition is exact equality.** A `startsWith` wildcard would
  let any subject this issuer can mint impersonate the service account.
- **IAM members are additive**, not bindings. A binding would replace
  every other member of that role in the project or on the log view.
- **`_Required` is queried in `global` by default.** If default resource
  settings moved that bucket, set `required_bucket_location` to match.
- Requires the `google` provider at 5.0 or later.

## Cloud de Confiance (S3NS)

S3NS is a separate Google Cloud universe. Set the universe on the **root**
provider; this module does not configure it. Project IDs carry the `s3ns:`
prefix. Workload identity principals still use `iam.googleapis.com`.

```hcl
provider "google" {
  project         = "s3ns:my-project"
  universe_domain = "s3nsapis.fr"
}
```

The service account email this module creates ends in
`.s3ns.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. Paste that email when you create the
connector so Probo dials `*.s3nsapis.fr`.
