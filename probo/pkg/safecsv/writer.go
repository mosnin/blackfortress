// Package safecsv wraps encoding/csv for exports that may contain user-controlled
// text. Writer sanitizes every cell before encoding to reduce spreadsheet formula
// injection when a file is opened in Excel, LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets, or
// similar tools.
//
// Use safecsv for all user-facing CSV downloads. Do not write export CSV with
// encoding/csv alone when record fields can contain untrusted or attacker-influenced
// content.
