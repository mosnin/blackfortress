// Endpoints groups every host-bearing URL a provider owns, so a deployment

//
// Auth, Token and Probe are complete URLs, query string included when the
// provider needs one. APIBase is a scheme-ful origin, optionally carrying a
// version segment, with NO trailing slash; drivers join paths onto it with
// url.JoinPath.
//
// An empty field means "not expressible here", never "unknown": an
// API-key-only provider has no Auth or Token, a provider with BuildProbeURL
// or a Probe closure has no static Probe, and APIBase is empty whenever the
// data host is per-connection or discovered at runtime.

	// from it. Empty for API-key-only providers and for providers using
	// BuildAuthURL or BuildAuthURLForSite.
	Auth string

	// Token is the OAuth2 token endpoint, independent of Auth: Monday serves
	// both from auth.monday.com, while HubSpot authorizes on app.hubspot.com
	// and exchanges on api.hubapi.com. Empty for API-key-only providers, for
	// BuildTokenURLForDomain / BuildTokenURLForSite providers, and for
	// 1Password, whose token endpoint is supplied per connection.
	Token string

	// Probe is the connection-check URL for a plain authenticated GET. Empty
	// when BuildProbeURL or the Probe closure is set. When both Probe and
	// APIBase are non-empty their hosts MUST match — Register enforces it, so
	// an APIBase override can never leave the connection check pointed at the
	// real provider while the driver talks to the override.
	Probe string

	// Identity is the host a provider's driver resolves its real data host
	// from, for providers that split identity from data. DocuSign is the
	// case: this endpoint's response carries the per-account `base_uri` that
	// every eSignature call then targets, so moving Identity moves the whole
	// connector while moving APIBase alone could not — DocuSign has no static
	// data root to move. Empty for every provider whose data host is either
	// static (APIBase) or supplied per connection.
	Identity string

	// APIBase is the data API root the driver joins paths onto, or — for a
	// GraphQL provider (Linear, Monday, Railway), which exposes a single

	// comes from connector settings (Grafana, Metabase, Okta, SigNoz,
	// Zendesk, Datadog, Langfuse, Segment, PostHog) or is discovered at

	// (app.crisp.chat vs api.crisp.chat) and must never be derived from it,
