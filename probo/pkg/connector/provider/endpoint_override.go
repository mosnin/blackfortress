// applyEndpointOverride returns reg's endpoints with o's non-empty fields
// substituted, rejecting any override that would not take effect, that would
// weaken the connection, or that would move only part of the provider's
// traffic.
//
// Two gates run before any field is substituted:
//
//   - Reach (unsupportedReason): some providers call at least one host that
//     is not expressed anywhere in Endpoints — Vercel's authorize URL and
//     OAuth callback, Crisp's connect-time subscription check, PostHog's
//     Cloud region discovery, Google Workspace's SDK-owned basePath. An
//     override could move what Endpoints DOES describe while those other
//     calls kept going to the real vendor, so such a provider refuses ANY
//     override rather than accept one that can only ever be partial.
//   - Atomicity: once any field is overridden, every field that is non-empty
//     in the provider's COMPILED Registration must be overridden too. This is
//     the fix for the bug an adversarial review found: an override that moved
//     DocuSign's Auth/Token/Probe but left Identity on its compiled value
//     produced a connector whose OAuth handshake and health check ran against
//     the sandbox while every account lookup — which resolves its host from
//     Identity — kept hitting production. The connection badge read healthy
//     for an environment the driver never reached. A field omitted from an
//     override is not "unset", it silently keeps its production value, so a
//     partial override is not a smaller version of a full one — it is a
//     deployment split across two environments that reports as one. For
//     DocuSign an override must set auth+token+probe+identity; for Brex
//     auth+token+probe+api-base; for an API-key provider with only a probe
//     and an api-base (Tally, for instance), those two.
//
// A field that is empty in the compiled Registration is NOT overridable
// regardless of atomicity. An empty Auth or Token means the provider builds
// it per flow (BuildAuthURL, BuildAuthURLForSite, BuildTokenURLForDomain,
// BuildTokenURLForSite); an empty APIBase or Identity means the host is
// customer-supplied through connector settings or discovered at runtime. In
// both cases the override would be silently ignored — and for a
// customer-supplied host, overriding it deployment-wide is exactly what the
// per-provider domain validators exist to prevent. Rejecting at startup turns
// a silent no-op into a boot failure the operator can see.
