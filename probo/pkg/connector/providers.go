// CIMDMetadataPath is the HTTP path serving the public OAuth Client ID

// (baseURL + CIMDMetadataPath) URL IS the OAuth client_id: the provider
// (e.g. PostHog) fetches this document server-to-server during the
// authorization flow to learn the client's name and redirect URIs, so no
// app pre-registration is required. The endpoint must be reachable
// unauthenticated from the public internet.
