-- Allow multiple connectors per (organization, provider, protocol) so an
-- organization can review access across several accounts of one provider
-- (e.g. two GitHub organizations, two Slack workspaces). The Slack messaging
-- worker used to rely on per-provider uniqueness to resolve the
-- organization's credential by provider alone; it now picks
-- deterministically (channel-configured first, then oldest), so no provider
-- keeps the cap.

DROP INDEX idx_connectors_organization_id_provider_protocol;

-- The dropped unique index was also the table's only organization-leading
-- index; keep a plain one for the per-organization lookups.
CREATE INDEX idx_connectors_organization_id_provider_lookup
    ON connectors (organization_id, provider);

-- Schema-forward-only: once intentional duplicates exist, the unique index
-- cannot be recreated without a product-level merge policy. Application
-- rollback keeps working (old binaries simply reconnect via their initiate
-- fallback); schema rollback does not.
