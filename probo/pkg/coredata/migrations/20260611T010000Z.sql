-- Access review: decouple campaign data from live sources.
--
-- Introduces a per-campaign source snapshot (access_review_campaign_sources)
-- that owns the source identity (name/category/connector) so a review survives
-- the deletion of the live access source. Fetch tracking becomes an append-only
-- log (access_review_campaign_source_fetch_attempts) so each fetch run keeps its own
-- error. Access entries are repointed from the live source to the snapshot.

-- Helper to mint a valid GID (base64url of: tenant 8B | entity type 2B |
-- timestamp 8B | random 6B) for back-filled rows.
