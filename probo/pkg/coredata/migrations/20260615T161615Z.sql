-- Unify the enrichment-tracking model across common_tracker_patterns and
-- common_third_parties. common_tracker_patterns gains a JSONB provenance
-- payload and an attempt counter (mirroring common_third_parties), and its
-- enriched_at done-flag is renamed to last_enrichment_attempt_at, stamped at
-- claim time. "Enriched" is now detected via the enrichment payload presence,
-- not the timestamp.
ALTER TABLE common_tracker_patterns
    ADD COLUMN enrichment          JSONB,
    ADD COLUMN enrichment_attempts INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

-- The DEFAULT only backfills existing rows; drop it so inserts must supply
-- the value explicitly.
ALTER TABLE common_tracker_patterns
    ALTER COLUMN enrichment_attempts DROP DEFAULT;

ALTER TABLE common_tracker_patterns
    RENAME COLUMN enriched_at TO last_enrichment_attempt_at;

-- Backfill the enriched-state marker for rows that were terminally enriched
-- under the old model. "Enriched" previously meant enriched_at IS NOT NULL (a
-- terminal done-flag); it now means a non-null enrichment payload. The rename
-- above moved the old done-flag into last_enrichment_attempt_at, so seed a
-- provenance payload for every row that carried it. Without this, rows already
-- enriched before the deploy would read as permanently unenriched. The payload
-- carries no per-field provenance, so completeness checks treat it as fully
-- enriched.
UPDATE common_tracker_patterns
SET enrichment = '{"status": "migrated"}'::jsonb
WHERE last_enrichment_attempt_at IS NOT NULL;

-- common_third_parties already carries enrichment/enrichment_attempts; give
-- it the same explicit last-attempt timestamp (previously only recorded in
-- the enrichment JSON) so the stale-recovery clock has a dedicated column.
ALTER TABLE common_third_parties
    ADD COLUMN last_enrichment_attempt_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Seed the new clock for rows that already spent an attempt. The claim path
-- stamps last_enrichment_attempt_at and updated_at together, so updated_at is
-- the historical proxy for the last attempt. Without this, a row claimed but
-- never completed before the migration keeps a NULL clock, and the stale-reset
-- predicate (last_enrichment_attempt_at < stale_before) can never be true for
-- NULL, so it would never be re-queued. Never-attempted rows keep a NULL clock.
UPDATE common_third_parties
SET last_enrichment_attempt_at = updated_at
WHERE enrichment_attempts > 0;
