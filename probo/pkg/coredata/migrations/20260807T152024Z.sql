-- Stamp rows created by the visitor request flow so portal UI can distinguish
-- them from admin-granted access (console Merge inserts with no request).
ALTER TABLE cp_document_accesses
    ADD COLUMN requested_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Only pending REQUESTED rows are unambiguous visitor BulkInsert provenance.
-- created_at < updated_at is not a source signal: console Merge inserts with
-- equal timestamps, but later admin status updates (e.g. grant → revoke) also
-- advance updated_at and would falsely prompt admin-only viewers. Leave
-- GRANTED/REJECTED/REVOKED historical rows unset; new requests and REJECTED/
-- REVOKED retries stamp requested_at going forward.
UPDATE cp_document_accesses
SET requested_at = created_at
