// ResolveOrCreateCommonThirdParty links a named vendor to the global catalog,
// creating a row when none matches. Dedup is deterministic: exact name, then
// slug, then the slug with a trailing legal form removed. Callers run inside
// their own transaction and pass the logger explicitly, so it is shared by the
// tracker mapping worker and the common pattern enrichment worker.
//
// Each rung admits only differences that carry no identity, because collapsing
// two distinct vendors is unrecoverable — every reference loses which one it
// meant — while two rows for one vendor are fixed by merging them.
//
// It never seeds common_third_party_domains: observed initiator domains are a
// co-occurrence signal, not verified ownership, and the catalog's domain set
// is owned by the curated seed.
