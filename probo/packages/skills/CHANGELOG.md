# Changelog

All notable changes to the `@probo/skills` package will be documented in
this file.

## Unreleased

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-04

### Changed

- Access review decision rubric no longer keys on `incremental_tag`, matching campaigns that are now independent snapshots

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- `access-review` skill reference: `auth_method` now lists `SSO`, `PASSWORD`, `API_KEY`, `OAUTH2`, `SSH`, and `SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, matching the API's actual values instead of omitting `OAUTH2` and `SSH`

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Agent Plugins 1.0.0 portable package: `plugin.json` and `mcp.json` at the
  package root, both declaring the canonical
  `https://agent-plugins.org/schemas/1.0.0/…` schema identifiers, so any
  conformant client can load the skills and Probo MCP servers without
  client-specific wiring
- Both hosted Probo instances ship as Streamable HTTP servers: `probo-us`
  (`https://us.probo.com/api/mcp/v1`) and `probo-eu`
  (`https://eu.probo.com/api/mcp/v1`)
- Validation of the Agent Plugins manifest and MCP schemas (closed field sets,
  plugin name constraints, transport variants, literal HTTPS URLs, no
  credential headers under any capitalization), of Agent Skills frontmatter
  (parsed as YAML, `name` matching the skill directory, `description`,
  `compatibility`, and `metadata` types, plus length limits for `description`
  and `compatibility`), and of `.mcp.json` parity with `mcp.json`. Optional
  fields must be absent rather than `null`, which the portable schemas reject

### Fixed

- MCP endpoint path: the Probo MCP API is served at `<instance-root>/api/mcp/v1`.
  The previous `/mcp/v1` path returned the console HTML page instead of the MCP
  endpoint, so no bundled server could connect
- `access-review` skill: server and organization selection are now separate
  preconditions, so both are resolved whichever one is ambiguous — a single
  self-hosted server serving several organizations included. Discovery uses
  `listOrganizations`, which takes no required input; it previously called
  `listAccessReviewCampaigns`, which requires the `organization_id` that
  discovery is meant to establish, so the step could not be executed as written.
  A merely non-empty result never settles the region, and anything short of a
  unique match asks the user. The reference documents both uses of
  `listOrganizations`

### Changed

- **Breaking:** MCP configuration no longer reads `PROBO_BASE_URL`. Agent
  Plugins performs no placeholder expansion in remote MCP URLs, so the hosted
  regional endpoints are declared literally. Self-hosted users add their
  instance in the agent, e.g.
  `claude mcp add --transport http probo https://probo.example.com/api/mcp/v1`
- Skills select a region instead of assuming a single `probo` server, and
  discover it by calling a list tool on each connected server when the region
  is unknown
- Client manifest versions (`.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`) track
  `package.json`, which validation now enforces

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- `access-review` skill: reference doc now points agents to the new `source_name` and `connector_id` entry fields instead of inferring the source tool from account data

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- `compliance-portal-commitments` skill: reference doc corrected to use the `compliance_portal_id` argument name (previously documented the stale `trust_center_id` name, which no longer matches the current API)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Skill: `compliance-portal-commitments` — create or update the public
  commitments shown on a Probo compliance portal, grounded strictly in the
  organization's own published Probo policies and written in a factual,
  understated engineering voice (references: `voice.md`, `portal-mechanics.md`)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- `@probo/skills` npm package with multi-agent manifests (`.claude-plugin/`,
  `.codex-plugin/`, `.agents/`) and Probo MCP wiring via `.mcp.json`
  (`PROBO_BASE_URL`, OAuth 2.0 sign-in)
- Skills: `open-source-compliance`, `access-review`, `missing-signatures`
- Commands: `access-review`, `missing-signatures` (Claude Code slash commands
  delegating to shared skills)
- Portable relative `references/` paths in skill bodies (no
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`)
- Resumable session notes for `access-review` and `missing-signatures`
- Repo-root marketplace catalogs for Git installs (`getprobo/probo`):
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (Claude Code) and
  `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` (Codex)
- Package-local marketplace catalogs under `packages/skills/`
- `COMPATIBILITY.md`, validation script, and release workflow
  (`release-npm-skills.yaml`, tag `@probo/skills/v*`)

### Changed

- Package published as `@probo/skills` in `packages/skills/` (multi-agent
  scope, not Claude-specific)
- Access-review skill records entry notes only after successful API writes
- Release checksums derived from `npm pack` tarball contents
- Validation enforces `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` structure and Codex
  marketplace shape; rejects non-object JSON roots in catalog files
