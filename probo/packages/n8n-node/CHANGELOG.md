## [0.233.0] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

  in risk analyses

## [0.232.0] - 2026-09-18

### Changed

- Risk Analysis `Create`, `Fork`, `Update`, `Get`, and `Get Many`
  treat `description` as plaintext (converted to ProseMirror JSON on
  write), matching Task operations

## [0.231.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Cookie Banner `Add GVL Vendor`, `Remove GVL Vendor`, `List GVL Catalog`,
  `List GVL Vendors`, and `Get GVL Catalog` actions, to pick which IAB
  Global Vendor List vendors a TCF-capable banner discloses
- `List GVL Vendors` takes a `Membership` filter (`On Banner` /
  `Not On Banner`); Cookie Banner `Get` returns the published version's
  GVL vendor count and IDs
- Risk `Create`, `Get`, `Get Many`, and `Update` expose `referenceId`, the
  org-scoped `RSK-001` display ID; `Get Many` can order by `Reference ID`
- Compliance Portal Access `Create`, `Activate`, and `Deactivate` return the
  visitor's identity (full name and email)

### Fixed

- `List GVL Catalog` and `List GVL Vendors` paginate through every page and
  offer `Return All` / `Limit` like other list actions, instead of silently
  returning only the first 50 rows

## [0.230.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Compliance Portal Access `Create` action, to add a portal visitor by member or email

  Provider`, `GCP Service Account Email`), including S3NS universe
  suffixes

  values (issuer, audience, subject, suggested service account name,
  Terraform snippet)
- `Firm` on Audit `Create` and `Update`, and `To Book` / `Audit Booked`
  added to the Audit state options; an empty firm on update clears it

### Changed

- Task and Task Comment operations return `content` as plaintext
  instead of ProseMirror JSON

### Removed

- Access Review `Read Entries` no longer returns `incrementalTag`

## [0.226.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- `Task Comment` resource (`Create`, `Get`, `Get Many`, `Update`, `Delete`) for description-only comments on a task, owned by a membership profile (the author by default)

## [0.224.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `As Of` on Risk Analysis `Get` and Treatment Plan `Get Many` reconstructs matrix cells and plans as of that instant; on Treatment Plan `Get Many` it requires `Risk Analysis ID`, and leaving it empty keeps reading live tables
- `State` on Task `Create`, and `Backlog`, `Canceled`, and `Duplicate` added to the Task state options

### Changed

- Treatment Plan `Get` and `Get Many` return the plan's `category`

## [0.223.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Risk Analysis `Fork`, copying diagrams, treatment plans, and their relations into a new analysis; matrix size stays on the source and the period starts empty

### Changed

- Date ranges are returned as nested `Period` objects: Audit `validity` / `auditDates` replace `validFrom`, `validUntil`, `auditStartDate`, `auditEndDate`, and Vendor `contract` replaces `contractStartDate` / `contractEndDate`. Operation input fields are unchanged

## [0.222.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- `Treatment Plan` resource (`Create`, `Get`, `Get Many`, `Update`, `Delete`) for plans that hold scores, treatment, and owner per (risk, analysis)
- Measure `Link Treatment Plan` / `Unlink Treatment Plan`
- Risk `Get Many`: `Risk Analysis ID` lists unplanned scenario-linked risks on that analysis
- Risk Analysis `Get` now returns `matrixCells`

### Changed

- Risk Analysis `Update` no longer accepts `Matrix Size`; matrix size is set at create only

## [0.221.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Tracker Pattern `Get` / `Get Many`: `attribution` catalog verdict inherited from the linked common tracker pattern

## [0.220.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- `Matrix Size` (`3×3`, `4×4`, `5×5`) option on Risk Analysis `Create` and `Update`, returned on `Get` / `Get Many`, so the likelihood/impact matrix size is explicit per analysis

### Fixed

- `Probo Trigger` no longer advertises itself as usable as an AI tool, which n8n could not honor for a trigger node

## [0.219.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- `AI System` resource (`Create`, `Get`, `Get Many`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Publish`), for managing an organization's AI Systems register
- `Period Start` / `Period End` fields on Risk Analysis `Create` and `Update`, and `period` on `Get` / `Get Many`
- `Compliance Portal Manager` and `Compliance Portal Access Manager` membership roles, for delegating full compliance portal management or just visitor access approval without broader admin access
- Cookie Banner `Update`: `Resource Reporting Enabled` option, to enable or disable resource detection on the banner

## [0.218.0] - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Risk Analysis `Scope` parameters are now called `Diagram` across all operations.

## [0.217.0] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- **Breaking**: the `Risk Assessment` resource is renamed to `Risk Analysis` (resource value `riskAssessment` -> `riskAnalysis`), along with its operations and parameters. Existing workflows using the Risk Assessment resource must reselect the Risk Analysis resource. Third-party assessments are unaffected.

### Added

- Document `Get Many`: `Published` filter option, to return only documents that have a published version

## [0.216.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Access Review: `Read Campaign Access Entries` operation, to read the access entries for an access review campaign
- Compliance Portal `Update`: `Rights Requests Enabled` option, to enable or disable rights requests on the compliance portal

## [0.215.1] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Organization Get Many: send `states: ['ACTIVE']` instead of the removed `state` field so the operation works again against servers that only accept the multi-value `ProfileFilter`

## [0.215.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- `subdivisionCode` (ISO 3166-2) returned by the Cookie Consent Record `Get` and `Get Many` operations, so workflows can branch on the detected state or province rather than country alone

## [0.214.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Access Review Source `Get Many` operation to list organization access review sources

## [0.213.0] - 2026-08-05

- Compliance Portal `Create Commitment Group`: `Trust Center ID` field renamed to `Compliance Portal ID`

## [0.210.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

## [0.209.0] - 2026-07-30

- User `Archive` operation renamed to `Deactivate`

## [0.208.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Audit `Create` and `Update` operations gained `Audit Start Date` and `Audit End Date` fields

## [0.207.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- User `Get Many` gained `Filter` (search by name/email), `Role`, and `Kind` fields, with the default page size raised to 100

### Changed

- Access Review `Create` and `Update` operations gained a multi-select `Sources` field to configure scope sources in the same call, replacing the separate `Add Source` operation

### Fixed

- Access Review source loader now paginates through all scoped sources instead of stopping at the first 500, so organizations with more sources can select them all when creating or updating a campaign

## [0.206.2] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- User Get no longer queries Connect `Organization.email`, which was removed and broke the operation; organization selection now matches User list/create/update

## [0.206.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- Organization Get/Get Many/Create no longer query removed Connect `Organization` profile fields (`description`, `websiteUrl`, `email`, `headquarterAddress`), which broke Organization Get Many. Use Compliance Portal Get/Update for those fields instead
- Compliance Portal Get now returns `entityName`, `description`, `websiteUrl`, `email`, and `headquarterAddress`, matching Compliance Portal Update, and selects `logo`/`darkLogo`/`nda` as File objects instead of removed URL scalars

## [0.206.0] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- Compliance Portal `Update` operation renamed the `Title` field to `Entity Name`, matching the compliance portal's short entity-name field

## [0.205.0] - 2026-07-21

### Removed

- `Organization` > `Update` no longer exposes Description, Website URL, Email, and Headquarter Address fields; use `Compliance Portal` > `Update` instead

## [0.204.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Trust Center commitment and commitment group operations (create, get all, update, delete) so workflows can manage compliance portal commitments end to end

## [0.203.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Renamed the risk operations' "Inherent" field label to "Initial", for consistency with the console and CLI

## [0.202.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Probo Trigger now logs webhook subscription delete failures instead of silently swallowing them
- Corrected the Probo Trigger codex node identifier and replaced unsupported marketplace categories to satisfy the n8n community-node review

## [0.202.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Probo Trigger output for `*:updated` events now includes an `updatedFrom` object alongside `data`, holding the entity snapshot from before the update so workflows can diff old vs new values (for example `{{ $json.updatedFrom.membership.role }}` vs `{{ $json.data.membership.role }}`)

## [0.201.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- `document.update` can now edit the current draft version's body, title, classification, and document type, creating a draft from the latest published version when none exists (empty fields are skipped)

### Changed

- Renamed the document-signature filter `state` field to `profileState`, matching the API rename and disambiguating it from the signature `states` field
- Corrected the document operation help text to note the content/body field expects a ProseMirror document JSON string, not markdown

### Removed

- `document.createDraftVersion` operation — editing the body via `document.update` now covers draft creation

## [0.200.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- `ProboTrigger` node that starts a workflow when Probo emits a webhook event; it owns the subscription lifecycle (creates it on activation, re-registers it when the webhook URL drifts, deletes it on deactivation) and verifies the HMAC-SHA256 signature constant-time
- Document lifecycle webhook events — document created/updated/archived/unarchived/deleted, version created/updated/published/rejected/deleted, version signature requested/signed/cancelled, and version approval quorum requested/approved/rejected/updated/voided

### Changed

- Default Probo Server credential URL is now `https://us.probo.com` (was `https://us.console.getprobo.com`)
- Update the node's codex metadata to satisfy n8n marketplace review — use supported `Development`/`Utility` categories and the scoped `@probo/n8n-nodes-probo.probo` node identifier

### Removed

- `MEETING_*` webhook event choices from the webhook create/update operations — they were never part of the backend event enum

- `resourceAlias` resource with `setAlias` and `removeAlias` operations on the trust center node

## [0.196.0] - 2026-06-19
