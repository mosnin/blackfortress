// Segmented control (single-select radio-cards over Base UI's ToggleGroup).
// There is no surrounding track: the items are standalone bordered cards laid
// out on an equal-width grid that wraps to new rows. Using a grid (rather than
// flex-wrap) keeps every card the same width and prevents a lone wrapped item
// from stretching across its row. Each card keeps a 1px border at all sizes
// (the pressed state only darkens the border, so selection never shifts layout).
