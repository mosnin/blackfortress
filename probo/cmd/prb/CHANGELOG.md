## [0.235.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- `connector list`, `connector view`, `connector discover`,
  `connector enable-accounts`, and `connector connect` manage connector
  accounts, so one connector credential can cover several accounts

  history

## [0.231.0] - 2026-09-18

### Changed

  ProseMirror JSON, and `view`/`list` render stored rich text as
  plaintext, matching tasks

## [0.230.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- `cookie-banner list-gvl-catalog`, `list-gvl-vendors`, `get-gvl-catalog`,

  `--order-by REFERENCE_ID`

### Removed

- `soa create --owner` and `soa update --owner`: statements of
  applicability no longer carry an owner

## [0.229.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- `compliance-portal access create` (alias `visitor`) adds a portal visitor by member or email; `compliance-portal access deactivate`/`activate` toggle access without revoking grants

- `task create`/`update` accept `--recurrence-interval` (an ISO-8601 duration, requires `--deadline`); completing a recurring task clones the next occurrence

## [0.228.0] - 2026-09-14

  field-level changes newest-first

## [0.227.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

## [0.226.0] - 2026-09-07

- `access-review source create --gcp-service-account-email` and `--gcp-workload-identity-provider` accept Sovereign Cloud de Confiance (S3NS) service accounts and dial `*.s3nsapis.fr` instead of public GCP

## [0.225.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- `audit create` and `audit update` accept `--firm` to record the firm running the engagement; an empty value on update clears it
- `audit` accepts the new `TO_BOOK` and `AUDIT_BOOKED` states, which sort ahead of `NOT_STARTED`

## [0.224.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- `access-review entry list` no longer supports `--incremental-tag` filtering (campaigns are independent snapshots now)

## [0.224.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- `task comment create`, `list`, `view`, `update`, and `delete` manage description-only comments on a task, owned by a membership profile (the author by default)

## [0.223.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `access-review source setup-aws` returns the AWS connector setup values (issuer, audience, subject, suggested role name, Terraform snippet, and CloudFormation quick-create URL) needed to create the audit role
- `--aws-role-arn` on `access-review source create` creates an AWS workload-identity connector and the access source in one call, deleting the connector again if source creation fails

### Changed

- `access-review source view` shows the connector's connection status

## [0.222.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `--as-of` on `risk-analysis view` and `treatment-plan list` reconstructs matrix cells and plans as of an RFC3339 instant; on `treatment-plan list` it requires `--risk-analysis`, and omitting it keeps reading live tables
- `--state` on `task create`, and `task create` / `task update` now validate the state against the server enum, which gained `BACKLOG`, `CANCELED`, and `DUPLICATE`

### Changed

- `treatment-plan list` and `treatment-plan view` report the plan's own category, falling back to the risk category when the plan has none

## [0.221.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- `risk-analysis fork <id>` copies a risk analysis's diagrams, treatment plans, and their relations into a new analysis for a later period

### Changed

- `access-review source create` reports when the source already exists for the connector instead of always claiming a fresh creation

## [0.220.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- `treatment-plan` command group (`create`, `list`, `view`, `update`, `delete`) for plans that hold scores, treatment, and owner per (risk, analysis)
- `measure link-treatment-plan` / `unlink-treatment-plan` to attach measures that drive plan progress
- `prb risk list --risk-analysis` lists unplanned scenario-linked risks on an analysis

### Changed

- `prb risk-analysis update` no longer accepts `--matrix-rows` / `--matrix-cols`; matrix size is fixed at create

## [0.219.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- `tracker-pattern list` / `view` show the catalog attribution (vendor name, first-party, or still-identifying) inherited from the linked catalog entry, for patterns with no vendor of their own

## [0.218.0] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- `prb access-review entry list --auth-method` now accepts `OAUTH2` and `SSH`, matching GitHub credential rows (OAuth app tokens and deploy keys) that were previously indistinguishable from API keys or service accounts

## [0.217.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- `--matrix-rows` / `--matrix-cols` flags (required, 3, 4, or 5) on `prb risk-analysis create` and `update`, shown as a column on `list` and `view`, so the likelihood/impact matrix size is explicit per analysis

## [0.216.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- `COMPLIANCE_PORTAL_MANAGER` and `COMPLIANCE_PORTAL_ACCESS_MANAGER` membership roles, filterable via `prb user list --role`, for delegating full compliance portal management or just visitor access approval without broader admin access

## [0.215.0] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- `prb access-review entry list` prints the admin column as `yes`, `no`, or `unknown`, so an account the source does not report on is no longer indistinguishable from a confirmed non-admin

## [0.214.0] - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Risk analysis scopes are now referred to as diagrams across the CLI

## [0.213.0] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- Compliance portal document, audit, and subprocessor selection is reversed: the console now lists the organization's own documents, audits, and subprocessors with checkboxes for inline portal membership, replacing the portal-only rows plus separate add dialogs
- Risk assessments are now named risk analyses across the CLI and MCP API

## [0.212.0] - 2026-08-06
