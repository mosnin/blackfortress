# Changelog

All notable changes to the `proboctl` CLI will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-16

### Removed

- `common-third-party merge` no longer reports relinked org tracker
  patterns, since patterns no longer link to an org third party

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- `common-third-party list --with-patterns` shows each entry's tracker pattern keys grouped by storage kind, to help judge whether a row is a real vendor
- `common-third-party show` / `list` display the review verdict (e.g. `REJECTED -> FIRST_PARTY`)

### Fixed

- `common-third-party prune` no longer offers to delete a catalog entry that has already been reviewed
- Removed a duplicate PowerLinks seed entry that was re-added on every reseed

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- `proboctl common-third-party review <slug> --verdict <VALIDATED|REJECTED>` — record a human review verdict on a catalog entry, and `--review <state>` on `list` to filter by review state so the backlog can be worked through

### Changed

- Seeded catalog entries are now marked reviewed on load, so the review backlog reflects only rows that actually need a human look instead of the whole catalog

### Fixed

- A verdict recorded by `common-third-party review` could be silently overwritten by a concurrent tracker-mapping run; the read is now locked against it
- The Microsoft catalog entry was seeded under the wrong category (`ANALYTICS` instead of `OTHER`), and a duplicate Tawk.to entry was removed

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- `proboctl common-third-party merge --into <winner> <loser>...` — fold duplicate catalog entries into one, repointing patterns, third parties, and domains and deleting the losers, across every tenant that references them
- `proboctl common-third-party find-duplicates` and `prune` — score and group likely catalog duplicates by name/domain/prefix signals, and delete catalog entries nothing references
- `mark-not-attributable` beside `mark-first-party` on `common-tracker-pattern`, for tracker keys that belong to neither the operator nor a vendor (browser extensions, other visitor-installed software)
- `--pattern-keyword` on `common-tracker-pattern list`/`reenrich`/`link`/`unlink`/`mark-first-party`/`mark-not-attributable` — matches the pattern key only, so a selection stays stable across actions that blank the agent-written description

### Changed

- A catalog merge now re-triggers organization backfill and re-enrichment for tracker patterns left pointing at a description written for the merged-away vendor
- Duplicate-winner selection breaks ties on name quality and enrichment completeness instead of creation time, and no longer strips country/region qualifiers from names before comparing them

### Fixed

- `prune`, the mark commands, and `common-third-party rename --reenrich` no longer race with concurrent enrichment: overlapping runs could delete a freshly-enriched row, re-arm enrichment on an already-settled row, or report rename success before the second write committed
- Merge previews now run the actual merge sequence in a rollback-only transaction instead of predicting it, so reported collision and relink counts match what the merge does
- `--min-score` and `prune --limit` reject invalid or out-of-range values instead of silently falling back to unsafe defaults (0, negative, or NaN could suppress or delete everything)
- `--pattern-keyword` values are escaped before use in the pattern match, closing a hole where `%` matched the entire catalog
- `prune` no longer skips every entry that has a domain — enrichment gives almost every entry one, which had made unwanted entries permanently unremovable
- The common-third-party seed no longer risks moving a vendor's domains onto a different row on reload; 23 domains previously claimed by more than one catalog entry are now uniquely assigned, and duplicate/non-vendor seed entries are merged or removed

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- `proboctl repair third-party-register-notes` — rewrite risk-assessment notes that were stored as raw Markdown in generated third-party register document versions into structured ProseMirror blocks, clearing cached PDFs so exports regenerate (`--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--org`, `--continue-on-error`)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-24

### Changed

- Enriched common third-party catalog entries with DPA, ToS, SLA, status/security/trust pages, subprocessor lists, and certifications from production data

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Bump `golang.org/x/image` to v0.43.0, remediating CVE-2026-33813 (denial of service via malformed WEBP parsing) and CVE-2026-46602 (missing tile-size limit in `x/image/tiff`)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- `common-tracker-pattern mark-first-party` now also blanks the stale description on the catalog row and its uncategorised org tracker patterns, so a terminal first-party row no longer keeps a description naming a cleared vendor
- Unlinking a vendor now has full parity with first-party cleanup: it clears the stale description on both the catalog row and its uncategorised org tracker patterns and remaps those patterns to drop the stale vendor and re-resolve (re-arming catalog enrichment)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- `proboctl common-tracker-pattern upsert` — create or update a catalog pattern by its natural key (tracker type, pattern, max age), applying each field only when its flag is passed and honoring the FIRST_PARTY and description-preservation invariants; `--enrich` re-arms the row for the async enrichment worker
- `proboctl common-tracker-pattern mark-first-party` and an `--attribution` filter on `common-tracker-pattern list` to audit and remediate wrongly attributed rows

### Changed

- `common-tracker-pattern` upsert now normalizes the attribution verdict when a vendor is linked or unlinked without `--attribution`: UNDETERMINED is promoted to THIRD_PARTY on link and THIRD_PARTY is downgraded to UNDETERMINED on unlink

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- `--enrich` flag on `common-third-party upsert` triggers enrichment immediately after upsert
- Enrichment provenance (state, attempts, last-run status, error, per-field confidence) now visible in `common-third-party` and `common-tracker-pattern` list and show views; enrichment tracking unified with outcome-based status

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- `proboctl common-third-party reenrich` — re-arm the async enrichment worker for selected catalog rows (verbatim via `--id`/`--slug`, or across the catalog via `--category`/`--keyword`/`--state`/`--status`), gated by `--dry-run` and `--yes`
- `proboctl common-third-party stats` — summarize the catalog by enrichment state and last run status
- `--state`/`--status` filters and `STATE`/`STATUS` columns on `common-third-party list`; enrichment state, attempts, last run status, error, per-field provenance, and discovered domains on `common-third-party show`

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- References updated to probo.com

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- `proboctl common-third-party upsert` — create or update a vendor in the global catalog (partial-merge, slug-keyed)
- `proboctl common-tracker-pattern link`/`unlink` — repoint or detach a catalog pattern's third party (link re-arms enrichment and remaps uncategorised org trackers)
- `proboctl common-tracker-pattern set-description` — write a description, mark the row enriched, and backfill linked org patterns
- `proboctl cookie-banner reset-trackers --keyword <substring>` — scope both glob decomposition and mapping reset to patterns whose pattern or display name contains the substring

### Changed

- `proboctl common-tracker-pattern reenrich` no longer requires a selection anchor; filter flags (e.g. `--without-description`) now select across the whole catalog when no anchor is supplied

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- `proboctl common-tracker-pattern` commands (`list`, `show`, `stats`, `reenrich`) for inspecting and re-running enrichment on the global common-tracker-pattern catalog; selection anchors via `--id`, `--linked-banner`, `--linked-org`, or `--common-third-party`, narrowed by `--tracker-type`/`--keyword`/`--state`/`--without-description`
- `proboctl common-third-party` commands (`list`, `show`) for inspecting the global common-third-party catalog
- `proboctl cookie-banner reset-trackers <banner-gid>` to rebuild a banner's uncategorised, non-excluded tracker patterns from `detected_trackers` and re-arm the analysis and mapping workers (`--mapping-only` skips the rebuild)
- Cursor-pagination flags on list commands (`--first`/`--after`, `--last`/`--before`), mirroring the GraphQL connection arguments, with cursors emitted in the output

### Changed

- `--first`/`--last` default to 50 when omitted; reject `--first` combined with `--before` (previously silently flipped to backward pagination)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Initial release of `proboctl`, a Cobra-based CLI for Probo instance management that connects directly to PostgreSQL
- `proboctl seed common-third-parties` — import the bundled third-party catalog (formerly the standalone `common-third-parties-import` command); `data.json` is embedded in the binary
- `proboctl seed common-tracker-patterns` — import bundled tracker patterns (formerly the standalone `common-tracker-patterns-import` command)
