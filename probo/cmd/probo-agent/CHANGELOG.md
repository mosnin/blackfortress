# Changelog

All notable changes to the `probo-agent` device posture agent will be
documented in this file.

## Unreleased

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- macOS installs that still ran the privileged daemon from
  `/usr/local/bin/probo-agent` now migrate themselves to
  `/Library/Probo/probo-agent` on next run: the launchd plist, tray
  autostart entry, and Team ID/identifier check are rewritten, the
  service reloads, and the legacy binary is removed.
- Windows no longer flashes a console window when Explorer starts the
  tray at logon. The installer now includes `probo-agent.exe` for CLI
  and service use, and `probo-agentw.exe` for tray and deeplink use.
  Thus, shells wait for CLI commands and propagate `ERRORLEVEL`.
- Windows enrollment no longer trusts a user-forged
  `ProgramData\Probo\run\enrolled` marker file. Production paths now
  require a SYSTEM or Administrators owner, and `Probo`, `run`, and
  `agent` directories are created with a protected DACL so standard
  users cannot write to them.
- Windows agent state directories under `%ProgramData%\Probo` now trust
  the Administrators group (not just SYSTEM), set it as owner on create,
  rewrite child DACLs, and re-secure the directory before token exchange
  and when loading state — closing a gap where UAC enroll or an
  inherited ACE could block or weaken protection.

  inherited ACE could block or weaken protection.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Tags of the form `probo-agent/vX.Y.Z-rc.N` now produce a GitHub
  prerelease, with installer versions stripped to `X.Y.Z`. Hosts that
  set `allow_prereleases` (install flag, MDM, or `config.json`) follow
  those RCs; everyone else stays on the last stable, so a test fleet can
  exercise a real signed build before it reaches every enrolled host.

### Fixed

- On macOS the agent binary lives at `/Library/Probo/probo-agent`. The
  privileged helper and LaunchDaemon no longer exec `/usr/local/bin/probo-agent`,
  which is user-writable on many Homebrew machines. The helper checks the
  Team ID and identifier before it runs the binary. An upgrade moves an
  existing daemon off the old path.
- Browser enrollment (`probo://` deep links) asks the user to confirm the
  server URL before a privileged install, except when TLS presents a
  pinned Probo leaf public key. Cancel leaves the device unenrolled.
  The dialog warns on cleartext HTTP and on hosts that are not pinned.
- API calls to `us.probo.com` and `eu.probo.com` require a pinned Probo
  leaf key. A Probo certificate key change fails enroll and heartbeats
  until the agent is updated. Self-hosted servers are unchanged.
- Windows agent state under `%ProgramData%\Probo\agent` uses an explicit
  DACL for SYSTEM and Administrators. A standard user cannot read
  `agent.key` or replace `config.json`. A user-owned or junction squat
  is refused, and existing files are re-ACL'd when the service starts.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Posture pushes are stamped with the agent's version, so the server can
  tell which agent observed a given check

### Fixed

- The Windows screen lock check keeps the last PASS or FAIL when no
  interactive user hives are loaded, so a signed-out host no longer flaps
  to UNKNOWN after a user was once observed
- The Windows screen lock check treats Entra ID users (`S-1-12-1-*`) as
  interactive hives, so a signed-in cloud account is no longer reported as
  "no interactive user hives loaded"
- The Windows password policy check reads the effective SAM minimum from
  `secedit` and the Intune DeviceLock PIN length, so domain- and
  Entra-joined machines no longer report UNKNOWN

## [0.6.5] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- The Windows firewall check no longer falls back to parsing localized `netsh`
  output, which reported a fully enabled firewall as off on non-English
  systems. It now reads the firewall COM API, which returns booleans and needs
  no module load, and both probes report the same evidence shape
- A firewall state that cannot be read reports Unknown instead of Off
- Posture runs cut short by sleep or shutdown are no longer sent, queued, or
  replayed as reports. A partial run described the host as it was powering off,
  and could surface a check as Unknown hours later when the queue drained
- The Windows screen lock check reads machine-wide policy — the machine
  inactivity limit, the MDM DeviceLock policy, and the full screensaver policy
  rather than only whether the screensaver is secure — so a managed host no
  longer reports Unknown when nobody is signed in
- `probo-agent collect` no longer truncates its own run on busy hosts, and
  reports an error rather than silently printing a short list

## [0.6.4] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Windows auto-update and time-sync checks now inspect stable service
  configuration instead of transient running state, and posture commands have
  more time to complete on busy systems.
- The agent no longer aborts with cobra's "command line tool" splash when
  Windows launches it with explorer.exe as the parent process, which broke
  browser-driven enrollment (probo:// deep links) and tray auto-start from
  the HKLM Run key.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- Windows checks for BitLocker protection, minimum password length, and
  time sync now parse structured state instead of matching English-only
  CLI substrings, fixing posture showing as Unknown on non-English
  Windows systems. A suspended BitLocker volume and a stopped time
  service now report Off instead of Unknown.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- Re-released with an updated code-signing certificate; no functional
  changes.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- Re-released with an updated code-signing certificate; no functional
  changes.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Devices list now shows the agent's last reported version alongside OS
  version, so rollouts can be tracked without opening each device.

### Changed

- Windows exe/MSI/tray icons are now generated from two shared master PNGs
  (a color mark and a macOS menu-bar outline) instead of separate
  per-platform rasters, so the icons can no longer drift out of sync.
- Devices list now shows short Windows OS version strings (e.g.
  `10.0.26200`) instead of the full localized `ver` banner, matching
  Darwin.

### Fixed

- Windows service now speaks the SCM service protocol after enroll, fixing
  the agent being stopped right after install (error 1053); the tray now
  autostarts via an HKLM-persisted entry with a proper ICO instead of being
  missing or blank.
- macOS PKG postinstall now calls the same `setup-tray` path as the Windows
  installer, fixing tray bootstrap being skipped on a PKG upgrade when the
  LaunchAgent plist was already up to date.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Windows MSI now embeds its cabinet instead of shipping it as a sidecar
  file, fixing installs that paired a downloaded MSI with the wrong
  arch's cabinet.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Windows installs now ship an Authenticode-signed MSI (Azure Trusted
  Signing) for initial install, alongside the existing zip archive used
  for auto-update.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- macOS auto-update no longer spawns new Background Task Management
  entries (and the generic executable icon) on every release; updated
  darwin archives are now signed with a stable identifier, signature
  downgrades are refused, and daemon/tray jobs are attributed to
  `Probo Agent.app`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Simplified the macOS PKG installer's welcome and conclusion screens to
  point straight at browser-based `/enroll` enrollment, dropping the CLI
  install steps, path inventories, and MDM notes.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Posture check submissions now carry a correlation ID grouping each agent push into a single report, powering paginated report history in the console

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Removed the white frame around the `Probo Agent.app` Finder/Dock icon by
  swapping in artwork with transparent corners.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Branded Finder icon for `Probo Agent.app` (generated from a master PNG
  via `sips`/`iconutil` at PKG build time).

### Fixed

- macOS auto-update posture check now reads all five Software Update
  preferences backing the System Settings toggles, resolving managed
  (MDM) values before system ones, so disabled downloads/installs are
  correctly reported as failing instead of PASS.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- macOS privileged helper (`com.probo.agent.helper`) embedded in
  `Probo Agent.app` and installed by PKG postinstall for XPC-driven
  browser enrollment (no SMJobBless / admin prompt on enroll).
- Hidden `probo-agent enroll-url --preflight` JSON output for the URL handler.
- `make -C cmd/probo-agent install|uninstall|clean` for local macOS PKG
  test loops (install tears down leftovers first).

### Changed

- Browser enrollment via `Probo Agent.app` uses HelperClient + XPC only
  (osascript elevation and enroll-time SMJobBless removed).
- macOS PKG / app builds require `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`.
- CLI `enroll-url` on macOS refuses elevation; use the signed app deeplink
  or `sudo probo-agent install`.
- macOS `probo-agent uninstall` requires root (`sudo`).
- PKG preinstall removes stale privileged helper files on upgrade;
  postinstall reinstalls the helper as root.
- macOS release now ships a single universal (arm64 + x86_64) fat
  `probo-agent_<version>_darwin.pkg` instead of separate per-arch packages.

### Fixed

- Windows elevated install/uninstall no longer reports success when the
  user cancels the UAC prompt.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- Support email updated to hello@probo.com

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Initial release of the Probo device posture agent.
- `probo-agent install`, `uninstall`, `run`, `status`, `collect` CLI
  commands.
- Managed OS service installation for macOS (`launchd`), Linux
  (`systemd`), FreeBSD (`rc.d`), and Windows (Service Control Manager).
- v1 posture check set per OS: disk encryption, screen lock, firewall,
  time sync, OS version, auto update, password policy, remote login.
- Enrollment / heartbeat / posture reporting against the new
  `/api/agent/v1` Probo REST API.
- Auto-update: the agent periodically checks GitHub Releases for a
  newer `probo-agent/v*` tag and self-installs it. The running binary
  is swapped atomically and the OS service supervisor is asked to
  restart via a dedicated exit code (`75`).
- Cosign signature verification of every release before installation:
  `checksums.txt.bundle` is verified with `sigstore-go` against the
  Sigstore public-good trust root, pinned to the GitHub Actions OIDC
  identity for `release-probo-agent.yaml` on a tagged commit. Releases
  without a Sigstore bundle, with an invalid bundle, or signed by a
  different workflow are rejected without touching the running
  binary.
- `probo-agent update [--check]` command for manual one-shot upgrade.
- `probo-agent install --no-auto-update` flag to opt out of automatic
  upgrades; the flag is persisted in `config.json` as
  `updates_disabled`.
- `probo-agent status` now reports the configured update interval and
  whether auto-update is enabled.
- Screen lock detection for additional Linux desktop environments: KDE
  Plasma, i3, Sway, Hyprland, Xfce, MATE, Cinnamon, UKUI, and LightDM.

### Fixed

- macOS launchd service label corrected to `com.probo.agent`.
- FreeBSD check command failures are now handled before reading service
  status.
- macOS postinstall script no longer uses `eval` to parse configuration.
- Windows agent key file replacement is now performed atomically.
- Windows service uninstall is now idempotent.
- FreeBSD `rc.d` install validates executable and state directory paths
  to prevent shell injection.
