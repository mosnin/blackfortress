# Changelog

All notable changes to `probod` (the server, including the bundled `@probo/console`, `@probo/compliance-portal`, `@probo/employee-portal`, and `@probo/ui` frontends) will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

## [0.301.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Settings > Integrations lists the vendors Probo holds a connector for
  and the ones it can still connect to. A connector opens to the accounts
  recorded against it and can be disconnected there; disconnect is
  refused while an access review source or SCIM configuration still uses
  the credential, and the message names which one

### Changed

- Trust center files no longer have a hidden (`NONE`) visibility; delete
  the file instead. Unlinking a document or audit from a trust center now
  clears its visitor access requests, and the console asks for
  confirmation first

### Fixed

- Back links from tracker, visitor, and user detail pages keep the list's
  filters instead of resetting them

## [0.300.0] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- Cookie banner Discovery is split into separate Trackers and Resources
  pages in the nav, and Discovery and Trail no longer show the banner
  header and publish actions, which stay on Configure
- Trackers and Resources lists are rebuilt on the v2 kit, with filters,
  pagination, and column sort kept in the URL so views are shareable
- Tracker edits (description, category, max age, inclusion) move from
  inline row forms to the tracker detail page, which also lists
  detections in a table. Row actions follow update and delete
  permissions

## [0.299.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Cookie pattern analysis collapses a hyphen-delimited UUID embedded in a
  cookie name into a single token, so keys like
  `community-form-<uuid>-creation` merge under one pattern instead of
  shredding into several fixed anchors

## [0.299.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- OVHcloud access review connector, on both the authorization-code and
  client-credentials paths (EU regions). The roster merges local users,
  the account owner, client-credentials service accounts, and the audit
  log for last login, the MFA a session used, and federated identities.
  Classic API credentials (consumer keys) are reported too, named by the
  application they belong to, with support-created ones called out. An
  identity whose group does not resolve to a role reports an unknown
  admin state rather than "not an admin"
- SAML SSO and SCIM are separate settings sections. SAML configurations
  are created and edited on their own pages instead of dialogs, with
  Optional or Required enforcement chosen up front, and cards show
  verification status and the DNS TXT record directly. SCIM starts from
  Google, Microsoft, or manual choice cards, and the configured page
  shows one provider card with a paginated event history over Relay
- Organization and measure tasks can be filtered by assignee in the
  console, GraphQL, MCP, CLI, and n8n. Former members stay selectable so
  tasks assigned to people whose contracts ended remain filterable
- Third parties can be searched by name

### Changed

- The OpenAI gateway uses the Responses API so current models work for
  both regular and streaming requests. Reasoning items replay on the
  next turn, tagged by provider. Frequency and presence penalties,
  caller-provided stop sequences, and invalid schemas are now rejected
  explicitly rather than silently ignored
- Third-party register documents export only the latest active risk
  assessment instead of every past one. Ties on created time break by
  the greater ID so the choice is stable
- SCIM provider overlays, manual SCIM credentials, and their export
  dialogs use the v2 UI kit. Export range and excluded emails are
  validated in the form instead of at the API
- The tasks page create action is a solid "Add Task" button and task
  list state headers sit on a darker background

### Fixed

- Connecting Supabase or Better Stack now checks the connector's
  settings before saving. A Better Stack global token whose team name
  matches none of its teams, or a Supabase token that cannot reach the
  organization, was saved, shown as connected, and then failed every
  campaign fetch with a generic message. The refusal is now reported
  under the setting's own field
- Slack MFA is read with an admin user token, since Slack returns
  `has_2fa` only to a workspace admin or owner. Members listed through a
  bot token were all reported MFA Disabled; unknown is now reported
  instead, and bot-token connections are flagged for reconnect. A
  revoked token, which Slack answers with HTTP 200 and `ok=false`, is
  reported as disconnected rather than connected
- The compliance portal `/llms.txt` crashed after the framework list and
  appended "internal server error" to a partial page
- Applying a mark across a hard break, or pasting styled HTML with an
  image inside a link, put marks on nodes that cannot carry them. The
  server rejected the document and every later edit failed until the
  page was reloaded, losing unsaved work
- `reset-trackers` no longer fails on banners with more than 10,000
  uncategorised globs, and no longer deadlocks against live detection
  reporting. Globs are walked page by page, claimed with
  `SKIP LOCKED`, committed one at a time, and deadlock retries are
  capped
- The brand form's dark-mode logo preview stayed white, hiding a light
  logo

## [0.298.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- Task comments stay in sync with a linked Linear issue. Publishing or
  linking copies existing comments, and later edits and deletes follow
  on both sides. A Linear comment whose author is not a Probo member
  is stored without an owner
- Organization and measure tasks can be filtered by name and state
  (`TaskFilter`) in the console, GraphQL, and MCP (`listTasks`,
  `listMeasureTasks`). Search matches `%` and `_` literally

### Changed

- Organization and measure task lists use the v2 UI kit. Each row shows
  a status select, the linked Linear issue, the assignee, and time
  estimate, deadline, and recurrence when set. Deleting a task is on
  the detail page; drag-and-drop reordering stays. Search and status
  live in the `q` and `status` URL params

### Fixed

- Cookie-banner tracker patterns treat slash-delimited keys as paths, so
  a trailing id collapses to one token (`clientSourceId/*`) instead of
  a separate glob per identifier. Short segments such as `2024` and
  `v1` stay in the pattern

## [0.297.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- Tasks can link to an existing Linear issue. Console, GraphQL, and MCP
  can search Linear issues in a team and link a task to one. The
  new-task dialog offers the same choice when Linear Sync is connected
- SigNoz access reviews list service accounts and their API keys,
  including admin accounts. Deleted accounts stay in the listing as
  inactive, and last login is the latest real use of an account's
  current keys

### Changed

- Linear teams are a paginated, searchable connection (`linearTeams` /
  `listLinearTeams`). The unpaginated team list is gone

### Fixed

- Status and priority menus in the task dialog open in the dialog
  overlay, so they no longer break the layout

## [0.296.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Connector installs can hold several accounts under one credential.
  Creating a connector records the initial account from its settings;
  discover and enable add the rest for AWS, GCP, and Azure. Available
  in console, GraphQL, MCP, the CLI, and the n8n node
- Task and task comment webhook events (created, updated, deleted) let
  automations follow task work, including task updates synced in from
  linked Linear issues
- Cmd+K (Ctrl+K) opens a page search listing the pages the viewer can
  open, without hunting the side nav
- Settings people page is rebuilt as a v2 Users page (`/settings/users`):
  a grid list with deactivated users sorted last, inline create and
  detail edit, contract dates through a new typed date field, and
  self-service avatar upload
- Findings can be filtered by audit: `FindingFilter.auditId` in the
  console GraphQL API, `filter.audit_id` on the `list_findings` MCP
  tool, and an audit select on the console findings page

### Fixed

- Access review reports Linear workspace owners as owners (not members)
  and uses Qovery's actual member role instead of the API token
  holder's role
- Rich text links (tasks, risks) open on a plain click instead of
  requiring Cmd/Ctrl+click
- Required now renders `required`/`aria-required` on Select and other
  non-native form controls, not just text inputs

## [0.295.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Tasks can stay linked to Linear. Console, GraphQL, CLI, and MCP can
  list Linear teams, publish a task as a Linear issue, and unlink it.
  Linked tasks stay aligned through a job queue; publish returns the
  issue identifier immediately
- Webhook subscriptions have a detail page with the endpoint, event
  types, signing secret, and delivery history. Deliveries can be
  filtered by status, and each one shows the outbound payload. The
  response can be copied, and list cards show the last delivery. The
  status filter and payload are also on GraphQL, MCP, and the CLI
- A stuck SCIM bridge can be reactivated from settings, the CLI, and
  MCP. That schedules the next sync for now, clears consecutive
  errors, and sets a failed or disabled bridge back to active

### Changed

- Webhook settings are a list of cards. Creating a subscription is its
  own page instead of a dialog, and opening a card goes to the detail
  page. Delivery history is labeled separately from subscribed events
- AWS, Azure, and GCP access-review connect forms show the workload
  identity example as field help, so it stays visible while typing

### Fixed

- SigNoz access-review rosters and the credential probe read users from
  the v2 API. A current SigNoz instance no longer marks a valid key as
  disconnected after GET /api/v1/user was removed. A key without the
  signoz-admin role is reported as refused

## [0.294.0] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Cookie banner TCF CMP ID comes from probod config
  (`cookie-banner.tcf-cmp-id` / `PROBOD_COOKIE_BANNER_TCF_CMP_ID`,
  default 4095) so self-hosted instances can use their own IAB ID
- TCF GET config includes the GVL catalog only when the request is GDPR
  or UK GDPR
- Public cookie-banner consent POST rejects a `tc` that is not a TCF 2.3
  string from this CMP, and requires `tc` on TCF banners when the
  request is GDPR or UK GDPR
- Cookie banner settings show the IAB `__tcfapi` stub and the TCF IIFE
  when the hidden TCF capability is on; non-TCF banners keep the default
  snippet

### Added

- Cookie banners store an IAB TCF publisher country of establishment
  (`publisherCountryCode`, default `AA`) and emit it on GET config
- Cookie categories store optional `tcfPurposeIds` so TCF purpose bits
  can be projected onto category slugs for activation and GCM. New
  banners map the default categories onto those purposes
- Cookie consent records persist an optional IAB TCF string (`tc`) from
  the public cookie-banner API, return it on GET visitor consent, and
  expose it on GraphQL, MCP, CLI, n8n, and the console record detail page
- TCF banners ship default first-layer and preference-panel copy
  (purposes, partners, storage, and legitimate-interest objection) in
  the supported banner languages
- Publish a risk analysis as a versioned generated document from the
  console, GraphQL, and MCP (`publishRiskAnalysis`)

## [0.293.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- Risks expose `riskAnalysisHistoryCount`, how many analyses still include
  the risk. The console delete confirm uses it to warn that deleting the
  risk also removes that history

### Changed

- Deleting a risk also removes it from risk-analysis history. Treatment-plan
  events no longer block the delete

### Fixed

- The device enrollment card hides "Open Probo Agent to finish registering
  this device." once the agent has checked in

## [0.292.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Access reviews can pull the MongoDB Atlas roster. The customer creates a
  service account in their own Atlas organization and supplies its client
  id and secret; Probo registers nothing. The roster covers every
  organization-level principal: active members, open invitations, service
  accounts, and programmatic API keys
- General settings is rebuilt as Workspace, with an Identity section and a
  Danger Zone. Logos upload through an image dropzone and are capped at
  5 MB, matching avatars

### Fixed

- Client-credentials connections mint a token instead of sending an empty
  bearer, so every request no longer came back 401. A refused exchange
  (an expired client secret, most often) is now reported as a provider
  failure rather than a Probo error
- The client-credentials token endpoint comes from the provider
  registration when it declares one, so the connect dialog no longer asks
  the customer to hand-type a URL the server already knows
- SCIM PUT no longer returns 500 when the incoming `externalId` already
  belongs to another profile in the organization (for example after a
  Google Workspace email change). The id is transferred, matching create
- Deleting a workspace clears it from the memberships list, and workspace
  settings no longer carry form state across organizations
- Risk analysis treatment plan rows show the `RSK-` reference ID, which
  previously appeared only on unplanned rows

## [0.291.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- The compliance-portal Slack page explains that reviewers must run
  `/probot login` before they can act on access requests from Slack
- Risk analysis descriptions use the same Tiptap rich text editor as
  tasks, stored as JSONB so the console, MCP, CLI, and n8n stay in sync
- Evidence preview renders CSV, text, and Markdown files in the console

### Fixed

- Unbound Slack clickers see an ephemeral `/probot login` error again.
  Block actions ignore the HTTP body, so the handler acknowledges Slack
  and posts the prompt to `response_url` without waiting on delivery

## [0.290.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Operators can choose which IAB Global Vendor List vendors a TCF-capable
  cookie banner discloses. The catalog is paginated and searchable, the
  selected set is stored per banner, and it is exposed on the console,
  GraphQL, MCP, CLI, and n8n
- The TCF page shows draft versus published vendor counts and can list only
  the vendors already on the banner, via a membership filter
- Risks get an immutable org-scoped `RSK-001` reference ID, matching
  findings, so they can be identified in lists and APIs without the GID

### Changed

- Compliance-portal visitors are identity-only: invite and self-provision
  create an identity and portal access rather than a People profile, so
  visitors no longer mix into org members
- The compliance-portal visitors list loads with the page query instead of a
  nested lazy query, so the request starts in the loader
- Magic links are verified with a same-origin fetch that returns JSON and
  navigates in the page, instead of a native form POST blocked by
  `form-action 'self'`
- Federation tokens set `nbf` a minute behind `iat`, so a verifier whose
  clock lags the issuer cannot reject a just-minted assertion
- Tracker patterns no longer link to an org third party; catalog
  identification is the sole vendor path

### Removed

- Common-catalog origin badges on the tracker list and detail views

### Fixed

- The Visitors page no longer fails for NDA-only users: the access list is
  resolved only once list permission is known
- The TCF draft badge compares vendor ID sets rather than counts, so
  removals and one-for-one swaps are reported correctly instead of reading
  as pending additions or as synced
- GVL vendors can be removed from a banner with TCF turned off, which
  previously stranded linked rows that no API could delete
- A lone `cookieBannerId` in the GVL filter is rejected instead of being
  silently dropped and returning the unfiltered global catalog
- Failed GVL vendor add/remove mutations no longer raise an unhandled
  rejection alongside the error toast
- Tracker policy vendor URL collapse sorts by ID, so the kept
  privacy-policy link is stable across regenerates when two catalog records
  share a name

## [0.289.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Azure access-review connector: reviews RBAC assignments for one
  subscription via workload identity, enriches last login and MFA from
  Entra ID (Premium P1/P2), and is exposed on every surface (console,
  GraphQL, MCP, CLI) alongside a Terraform `azurerm` audit-role module
  for a portable install
- Tasks accept a recurrence interval (an ISO-8601 duration); completing
  a recurring task clones the next occurrence and carries the interval
  forward
- Operators can add compliance-portal visitors by member or email, and
  deactivate/reactivate them without revoking grants

### Changed

- Compliance-portal access is gated on the visitor's own access state
  instead of org-membership state, so deactivating an employee no
  longer locks them out of visitor grants
- Adding or reactivating a visitor sends a grant email (the same
  portal-URL mail used for Slack grants) exactly once, only while the
  visitor is active and newly granted
- Console wording changed from Invite to Add throughout (console, CLI,
  n8n, MCP); visitors who have not signed in show as "not visited"
- The add-visitor flow is a popover instead of a dialog, with stable
  typeahead results while typing and no empty state when adding by
  email

## [0.288.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Access review connectors for Attio, ElevenLabs, New Relic, Retool and
  Twingate: each is connected with an API key bound to a single
  workspace, organization or network, so none of them asks for a
  tenant picker
- Crisp is now connected by installing the Probo app from Crisp rather
  than pasting a code: Probo redirects to Crisp, the customer picks a
  website, and Probo verifies the returned subscription token
  server-side against its own plugin credential. The connector stays
  hidden until an operator sets `PROBOD_CONNECTOR_CRISP_PLUGIN_TOKEN`
  and `PROBOD_CONNECTOR_CRISP_PLUGIN_ID`
- Task details gain an activity tab listing field-level changes
  newest-first, with the same list exposed on GraphQL, MCP, the CLI
  and n8n
- Google and Microsoft sign-in accept personal accounts when the
  continue URL is a compliance-portal authorize request; console SSO
  stays enterprise-only

### Changed

- Sign-in hides Create account and password login for compliance-portal
  visitors, who sign in with a magic link, and hides register links on
  instances where signup is disabled
- Brand lime is a theme-aware token, so washes no longer stay neon in
  dark mode

### Fixed

- Crisp access reviews no longer list the Marketplace sandbox member as
  a second account for the workspace owner, and report each operator's
  two-factor state instead of leaving it unknown
- A connector sync no longer fails when a GraphQL provider answers a
  recoverable error: the retried request body is rewound instead of
  being resent empty

## [0.287.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Findings can now be linked to specific audits: audit-specific finding
  references are exposed via GraphQL, with a two-step linking flow in
  finding details that displays linked audits with their report
  references and supports unlinking them in place
- Spanish employee portal translations

### Fixed

- OAuth2 protected-resource matching accepts a resource that differs from
  an advertised one only by the root trailing slash, scoped to http(s)
  resources as RFC 3986 section 6.2.3 defines
- Task comments are now deleted before the organization cascade, fixing
  organization deletion failing because task comments blocked deleting
  the underlying membership profiles

## [0.286.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Device postures are stamped with a schema version and the observing agent's version, exposed via GraphQL, MCP, and the CLI; older agents fall back to their last heartbeat version so a rolling deploy keeps reporting

## [0.285.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Fifteen more connector providers declare a pasted-key prefix
  (Anthropic, Brevo, Brex, Cal.com, ClickHouse Cloud, Dotfile,
  Metabase, OpenAI, Qovery, Resend, SendGrid, Supabase, Tailscale,
  Tally, UpCloud), so a truncated, wrong-kind, or otherwise malformed
  key is rejected in the connect dialog instead of reaching the
  provider

### Changed

- Task duration fields keep calendar months: GraphQL and MCP expose
  `TimeSpan` instead of `Duration`, so `P1M` round-trips instead of
  flattening to about 30 days

### Fixed

- Employee portal assume still runs when `ssoLoginURL` errors; that
  field error no longer aborts the query before
  `assumeOrganizationSession`

## [0.284.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Audit list shows the audit and validity periods as two compact date ranges instead of four separate columns, with guarded parsing so malformed or out-of-order dates render safely instead of crashing

## [0.283.1] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Windows time sync and auto-update postures reported by probo-agent 0.6.4 and
  later no longer display as Unknown. The agent renamed the evidence it sends
  for those checks when it moved from transient service state to service
  configuration, and the reader still expected the old keys

## [0.283.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Search the document list by title, debounced and persisted in the URL

### Fixed

- OAuth dynamic client registration now accepts the standard `scope` field (a space-delimited string) in addition to `scopes`, so clients following RFC 7591 register successfully

## [0.282.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Identity avatars: upload a photo shown on people lists and owner cells without a profile page, stored as a public file with EXIF stripped; falls back to initials when none is uploaded

### Changed

- Remove the risk analysis last-updated timestamp from the frontend: it only reflected edits to the parent record, not to diagrams, scenarios, treatment-plan results, or measure status, so it was misleading

### Fixed

- MCP `ListCookieCategoriesTool` now honours the `exclude_kind` filter argument instead of ignoring it, so callers can enumerate all categories including `UNCATEGORISED`

## [0.281.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- GCP access-review connector setup: `gcpConnectorSetup` query, create fields, and a dedicated console connect page for workload-identity federation
- Task descriptions and comments use the same Tiptap rich text editor as documents, stored as JSONB content; comments speak markdown over MCP the same way document content does

### Changed

- GCP access-review activity driver reads only the `_Required` log bucket's `_AllLogs` view (`roles/logging.viewAccessor`) instead of project-wide `roles/logging.viewer`, so the impersonated token can no longer read application logs in `_Default`
- GCP connectors recognize Sovereign Cloud de Confiance (S3NS) service accounts and dial `*.s3nsapis.fr` instead of public GCP

## [0.280.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- GCP project IAM access-review driver: lists project IAM principals and service accounts, degrading gracefully when service-account listing is denied, with best-effort last activity (Admin Activity for users, Policy Analyzer with a Cloud Audit Logs fallback for service accounts) and MFA (Directory 2-Step Verification enrollment for users)
- A connector provider may declare the shape of a pasted API key; the connect dialog checks it as the field loses focus and the create resolver checks and trims it again, catching a truncated or malformed paste before it is stored (Langfuse is the first provider to declare one)

### Changed

- GCP access-review MFA now uses the same WIF-impersonated service-account
  token with `admin.directory.user.readonly` in addition to
  `cloud-platform`. A Workspace Users-read admin role on that service
  account is still required; a Directory 403 keeps identities and last
  login and leaves MFA unknown.

### Fixed

- A connector probe now tells a refused request (403) from a refused credential (401): the source row reports the operation as not authorized, pointing at the plan and permissions with a link to the provider's setup guide, instead of claiming the credentials are invalid
- Employee portal PDF viewer: a `pdfjs-dist@6` pin bundled a worker that did not match `react-pdf`'s 5.4 API, breaking signature and approval document previews

## [0.279.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Audits gain `TO_BOOK` and `AUDIT_BOOKED` states ahead of `NOT_STARTED`, plus an optional audit firm on create and update, across GraphQL, MCP, CLI, n8n, and the console (clearing the firm removes an obsolete assignment)

### Changed

- Signing up no longer opens a session: the account is confirmed first, and the session is created when email verification flips the address to verified. Verification requires an explicit click, so email scanners that prefetch links cannot sign themselves in
- Magic-link and confirmation tokens are consumed only on an explicit POST, and an already-verified email is treated as success so confirmation stays idempotent
- The console `/auth` zone moved to the v2 kit: the login hub leads with email (SAML when the domain is unique, otherwise a magic link), Google and Microsoft sit below, password is a quiet link, forgot-password sits under the password field, and the assume page renders inside the auth layout
- The console organization picker now matches the employee portal
- Empty-token errors explain that the token must be typed or the link opened from email, instead of repeating the field label

### Fixed

- SSO login URLs are no longer offered for SAML configs that are turned off, which previously sent people into a login that rejected them
- Deleting an organization failed when control, risk, or measure mappings still referenced its documents and risks; those rows are now removed first
- Generated documents are sanitized before insert, so malformed content is rejected instead of rendering as escaped raw JSON in exported PDFs
- `listTrackerPatterns` no longer errors on a whole page when it contains a pattern whose source is `HTTP`
- Wide document tables wrap their cells instead of only being readable by scrolling sideways

## [0.278.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- GCP Workload Identity Federation connector: registers GCP alongside AWS for the access-review source, with a Terraform module reference and console provider entry (access-review driver still pending)

### Fixed

- Access review campaigns no longer diff against the previous campaign's incremental tags; each campaign is now an independent snapshot (previously this could resurrect accounts the source no longer returned, and the console never showed the tag)
- Linear access-review source now includes disabled/suspended users, which were previously omitted unless `includeDisabled` was requested

## [0.277.2] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Bumped golang.org/x/crypto to 0.56.0, addressing denial-of-service on
  deadlocked SSH channels (CVE-2026-78662, CVE-2026-56855)

## [0.277.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Bumped fast-uri to 3.1.6 and qs to 6.16.0, addressing a decoded-scheme
  rejection bypass (CVE-2026-76172) and array-limit / isBuffer denial-of-service
  issues (GHSA-x5fp-wj9c-mxmx, GHSA-4mjr-xmp4-gh2g)

## [0.277.0] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- Document download dialog starts with signatures unchecked so users
  must explicitly request signature pages
- AWS Identity Center access-review Auth now maps EXTERNAL_IDP to SSO,
  local factors (password, email OTP, passkey, TOTP) to PASSWORD, and
  no observed CredentialType to UNKNOWN instead of labeling every user
  SSO

### Removed

- Personal API key creation UI and its GraphQL creation mutation; use
  scoped OAuth access tokens instead

### Fixed

- Organization deletion no longer fails when related rows still
  reference it; missing organization_id foreign keys cascade, and the
  IAM service deletes rows that restrict on membership-profile owners
  or scenario-linked risks
- Access-review source name-sync no longer retries a failing provider
  without bound, which could flood logs and block later sources; five
  attempts over fifteen minutes then keep the generic name until
  reconnect
- Connector probe now rejects a 2xx response whose body opens with '<'
  so a customer-supplied URL that hits an SPA or SSO portal is not
  reported healthy

## [0.276.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Task details page comments: description-only notes owned by a membership profile (the author by default), ordered oldest first, and available on GraphQL so discussion lives on the work itself
- AWS Identity Center access-review entries now include MFA status and last login from CloudTrail Event History (90 days) and registered MFA devices or a TOTP/WebAuthn sign-in; enrichment failures keep the listed users and leave those signals unknown
- AWS access review now includes Identity Center users with no permission-set assignment on the connected account (empty roles). MFA device lookup is skipped for those users so a large unused directory stays inside the fetch budget. Still no Organizations walk and no cross-account assignment listing
- AWS root account identities now show the Organizations account email when the audit role can call DescribeAccount, so reviewers can match `<root_account>` to a person; standalone accounts and denied Organizations calls leave email empty
- Provider catalog and AWS connector create flow link to the AWS access-review setup guide at `/aws`

### Changed

- Business-function MTD, RTO, and RPO columns show hours and remaining minutes instead of a raw minute count
- Access-review source names separate the provider label from the account with a slash (`Amazon Web Services / acme-prod`) instead of a space

## [0.275.0] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- AWS connector now labels access-review sources with the full "Amazon Web Services" name instead of the "AWS" abbreviation
- SCIM event timestamps in the console now show the full date and time down to the second, instead of a relative or short date

### Fixed

- AWS Identity Center discovery now walks Identity Center regions until `ListInstances` returns an instance, instead of only the session region (`us-east-1` on commercial AWS). IAM-only degrade remains when no instance exists, `ListInstances` is AccessDenied, or the role cannot finish the SSO Admin walk.

## [0.274.2] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- Bumped gRPC-Go to 1.83.1, addressing an HTTP/2 receive-buffer memory exhaustion issue (CVE-2026-84304)

## [0.274.1] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- Employee-portal document queue no longer dead-ends at the last document when items are skipped or the queue is entered mid-list; Next and Finish now wrap back to the documents left over, including ones signed while the next page was still loading
- Start-to-sign and start-to-approve from the employee-portal home now open the first document of the queue instead of dropping into the middle of the list

## [0.274.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- AWS access review now lists Identity Center users assigned to the connected account (directly or through a group) when an instance is visible in the session region; the walk degrades to IAM-only when the account has no instance, the role cannot read SSO Admin (including after ListInstances succeeds), or the instance lives in another region. There is still no Organizations walk and no cross-account assignment listing
- AWS access-review sources are named with the connected account name (`AWS acme-prod`) when Account Management returns one, then the sign-in alias, then the account ID, so two accounts in one organization stay distinguishable; the source-name worker assumes the audit role to resolve those. The console still shows the account ID until the worker runs

### Changed

- Document list rows are fully clickable: the whole row navigates to the viewer instead of only the title or action button, rendered as a single data cell instead of a spanning row header
- Queue navigation swipes to the next document immediately instead of waiting for the query and showing a skeleton first
- Document tabs show the open document's title instead of the static "Probo Console" title, so multiple open documents are distinguishable in the browser tab strip

### Removed

- Leftover console employee-portal pages (signatures, approvals, devices, enroll, Slack bind), now fully owned by the dedicated employee-portal app; the old pages never rendered in production

### Fixed

- Long document lists no longer show empty space below the table from an unwanted vertical scrollbar
- Document loading skeleton matches the live request panel layout instead of missing the back-link row
- TableLink focus ring no longer shows an opaque wash covering row text
- A refused quorum's reviewed document is no longer lost when a later quorum is accepted; the PDF is now generated in a dedicated worker and kept with the quorum

## [0.273.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- AWS access-review connector setup, create, and verify: a console dialog and `awsConnectorSetup` query return the issuer, audience, subject, suggested role name, and matching Terraform/CloudFormation snippet so operators can create a workload-identity AWS connector without inventing values
- Task details page holding name, description, and properties, so the tasks list can stay to the title instead of showing the full description on every row

## [0.272.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Risk analysis treatment plans can be reconstructed as of a past date: the heatmap, plan table, and measures show the state they had at that instant, with each event storing the full plan so an as-of read returns the latest row; today keeps reading live data
- AWS access review driver listing the IAM users of the connected account, with groups, attached and inline policies as grants and activity read from the credential report; the connector names one account, so there is no Organizations walk and no Identity Center listing
- `BACKLOG`, `CANCELED`, and `DUPLICATE` task states, selectable when creating or updating a task
- A back link on employee portal document, approval, and signature viewers, so leaving a viewer no longer depends on a decision being made first

### Changed

- Device enrollment moved to the employee portal at `/employee-portal/enroll`, adding an organization picker first step since `/enroll` carried no organization in the URL; the legacy path 302s so agents and bookmarks keep working
- Slack bind and bindings pages moved to the employee portal, with a Slack card on the portal home rendered only when the organization has Slack installed; the old console URLs 302s so links in existing Slack DMs keep working
- The document viewer top bar stretches to the full-bleed viewer width instead of staying inset at 1024px
- Risk analysis list rows wrap long names and periods instead of pushing the description column out, and clamp very long descriptions to two lines

### Fixed

- `.log` evidence uploads on measures are accepted; browsers report them as `text/plain` while only `text/x-log` was allowed
- SOC 2 framework wording

## [0.271.1] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- Presigned S3 download URLs (documents, framework exports, third-party agreements) no longer fail with a signature mismatch, caused by a checksum-validation header the SDK signed into the URL but that downloading clients never send back

## [0.271.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Employee portal, a dedicated app at `/employee-portal` replacing the console's employee pages: organization list, home dashboard with a Get Started panel while the viewer still has first pending work, and typed 404, 403, and 500 recovery states
- Signature and approval queues in the employee portal, each splitting pending work from history with independent pagination, table layouts that keep columns aligned across locales, and a frozen queue so the counter does not shrink while signing
- Document viewers in the employee portal for signing and approving, with version history that swaps the displayed PDF for inspection while sign and approve still target the latest version
- Employee device pages in the employee portal: a device list with empty state, a three-step registration wizard covering agent download and enrollment, and manual enrollment issuing a one-time token with CLI instructions
- French and Dutch employee portal catalogs; both locales were listed as supported but every string fell back to English
- AWS audit role CloudFormation template and Terraform module creating the OIDC provider and a ProboAudit role, with organization-wide coverage as a service-managed StackSet; the trust policy is read back before a connector relies on it and refused when its `sub` condition is absent, wildcarded, `StringLike`, or pinned to another organization
- Documentation links on the authentik, Brex, Cal.com, Calendly, and GitHub access-review connectors, so the connect dialog and connections list can reach each setup guide

### Changed

- An organization can hold several connectors of one provider — two GitHub organizations, two Slack workspaces — each backing its own access review source, and the console keeps every provider available for another connection
- Reconnecting a connector is now explicit: a bare initiate always creates a new connector, and reconnect happens only through an explicit connector id
- Each connector credential is owned by exactly one feature, an access review source or a SCIM provisioning bridge, enforced by schema; deleting a connector still held by a live bridge is refused instead of silently disabling sync
- Source creation is idempotent per connector, so replaying an OAuth callback in two tabs cannot double-create, and relinking a source to a new connector deletes the abandoned one instead of stranding it
- SCIM configuration and its bridge are created in one transaction, so a bridge refusal can no longer leave a bridgeless configuration blocking every retry of the connect flow
- Old console employee URLs now redirect to the employee portal, so existing inbox links keep working; emails, the organization switcher, and the employee landing point there directly
- Connector probe failures are logged with a classification code, provider, source id, and connector id, so a permanently broken source is attributable to a tenant instead of leaving no diagnostics

### Fixed

- Employee document filters matched any historical signature or past approval decision, so a newer pending major version appeared as both pending and completed; both filters are now restricted to the latest version
- Probe verdicts treated cancelled requests, timeouts, and URL parse failures as the provider rejecting a credential, and the Railway probe reported a 5xx or rate limit as a dead credential
- The signing queue started mid-queue when launched from page 2 or later, and overlapping pager clicks could land on the wrong page
- Copying an enrollment token threw in insecure contexts before the failure toast could show, and enrollment errors stacked a global toast on top of the inline failed state
- Dropped the unused `reports` table and leftover `report_id` foreign keys, superseded by audit PDFs stored in `files`

## [0.270.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- AWS connector on the WORKLOAD_IDENTITY protocol: one connector covers a whole AWS organization, the customer grants access in their own account so there is no credential to paste or configure, and the accounts beneath it are tracked as cloud accounts
- Search on the compliance portal visitors list, matching membership name and identity email so people who have not recorded a name still show up
- Fork a risk analysis, copying diagrams, treatment plans, and their relations into a new analysis so a later period reuses the graph; matrix size stays on the source and the period starts empty
- Versioned IAB GVL catalog tables storing immutable vendor-list snapshots, so TCF resolves IAB vendor IDs without folding them into the common third-party register

### Changed

- Visitors sort by pending request count by default instead of newest join, with the list toolbar switching to join date and announcing the active sort to screen readers
- Visitor documents are ordered and filtered by access status on the server through a unified resources connection, with the filter kept in the URL
- Visitors and document access lists paginate with Show more, fetching 50 rows at a time instead of a fixed first page
- Validity, audit, and contract ranges use the GraphQL `Period` type, sharing one shape across console, connect, MCP, CLI, n8n, and the UI

### Fixed

- Deactivated portal visitors were dimmed and their grant actions disabled, though membership deactivation blocks console sessions rather than portal sign-in

## [0.269.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Visitors get a dedicated page in the compliance portal permissions zone, replacing the Edit Access dialog: document grants have their own table and URL, changes save immediately, and multi-select with a bulk bar grants or rejects several documents at once
- NDA card accepts a PDF drop directly, with download and delete controls in its header and the signature audit trail behind an activity popover

### Changed

- Migrated the compliance portal permissions zone to UI v2, including a new native Table in `@probo/ui`, visitors restyled as a list showing NDA status and join date, and pending requests surfaced as a button
- Renamed the portal permissions route to `visitors`, so the URL, navigation, and Slack action links match the page name
- PDF watermarks now show the document's own classification instead of a hardcoded "Confidential"
- Each compliance portal page owns its H1, description, and document title instead of repeating the portal name

### Fixed

- Compliance portal document access reused source GIDs for rows that did not exist yet, so Relay saw conflicting typenames on the access list; grant and reject now upsert a real row and leave sibling documents untouched
- Visitor list row edges were not clickable because list padding sat outside the link

## [0.268.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Treatment plans on risk analyses: scores, treatment, and owner live on a plan unique to one risk and one analysis (the risk must already sit on a scenario), so the same catalog risk can evolve across periods; linked measures drive progress from inherent to residual except Accepted which stays inherent
- Risk analysis pages split heatmap and plan table from diagrams
- WORKLOAD_IDENTITY connector protocol: Probo mints a short-lived OIDC assertion and the customer's STS exchanges it for temporary credentials against a role they own, so the connection stores no credential

### Changed

- Matrix size is chosen when creating a risk analysis and cannot be changed later
- Access-review connect actions use a split button when a source supports more than one method (GitHub App, OAuth, API key)

### Fixed

- Slack access-request cards still linked to pre-`/governance` document and audit paths, so reviewers hit 404s
- PDF exports of documents with omitted ProseMirror node attributes (for example a table cell without colspan) showed raw JSON instead of the rendered document

## [0.267.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Catalog attribution (vendor name, first-party, or still-identifying) now shows on tracker pages in console, GraphQL, and MCP, for patterns whose catalog entry has no vendor name of its own

### Changed

- Migrated the compliance portal integrations page to UI v2, including a reworked Slack channel picker (correct icon, wider card, refreshes on open, fixed pagination)

## [0.266.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- ChatGPT and Codex MCP OAuth compatibility through CIMD auth-method negotiation, RFC 9207 issuer identification, and resource-bound access and refresh tokens

### Migration

Before starting this release, apply `20260824T102541Z.sql`, replace the URL
below with the exact `PROBOD_BASE_URL`, and run:

```sql
BEGIN;

UPDATE iam_oauth2_authorization_codes
SET resources = ARRAY['https://your-probo.example.com']
WHERE resources IS NULL;

UPDATE iam_oauth2_consents
SET resources = ARRAY['https://your-probo.example.com']
WHERE resources IS NULL;

UPDATE iam_oauth2_access_tokens
SET resources = ARRAY['https://your-probo.example.com']
WHERE resources IS NULL
  AND client_id IS NOT NULL;

UPDATE iam_oauth2_refresh_tokens
SET resources = ARRAY['https://your-probo.example.com']
WHERE resources IS NULL;

COMMIT;
```

Manual access tokens remain unbound because they have no `client_id`.

## [0.265.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- The GitHub App connector's authorization URL didn't pin a redirect_uri, so GitHub could send installs to the wrong callback URL on deployments with more than one registered

## [0.265.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- GitHub App as an access-review connector alongside OAuth and personal access tokens: users authorize an app installation, short-lived installation tokens are minted automatically, and connector health checks are protocol-aware
- OAuth2 and SSH auth methods for access-review entries, so GitHub App tokens and deploy keys are recognized instead of being reported as API keys or service accounts
- Resend as an access-review connector via CIMD authentication
- Human review tracking for third-party catalog entries: a reviewer can mark a catalog row validated or rejected, and the tracker mapping pipeline now honors a rejected verdict instead of re-attributing it to a vendor

### Changed

- Compliance portal hosting page redesigned onto the v2 UI kit: domain cards restyled around SSL status, an inline form replaces the domain dialog, and visibility is split into switch cards
- Access-review table columns widened to fit longer connector labels; GitHub App and OAuth2 connector callbacks now route through separate endpoints instead of sharing one

### Fixed

- A concurrent review update could be silently overwritten mid-mapping-run because the read wasn't locked
- The organization picker for API keys, which had regressed
- Mermaid diagrams duplicating nodes
- The Microsoft catalog entry's category and a duplicate Tawk.to catalog entry
- Upserting a common third party that already existed was reported as created instead of updated

## [0.264.1] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- The Cal.com and Calendly connectors were missing their client secret from required-configuration validation and `.env.example`, so a misconfigured deployment would silently fail instead of being caught at startup

## [0.264.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- A per-organization cloud identity issuer: probod can now act as an outbound OIDC provider, minting short-lived tokens scoped to one organization so audits inside customer AWS accounts no longer require long-lived shared credentials
- Calendly and Cal.com as access review connectors, both via OAuth (Cal.com also supports team accounts), with provider icons in the connector list

### Changed

- Webhook deliveries now run as durable jobs with processing leases, retry scheduling, stale-delivery recovery, and a terminal dead-letter state, with idempotency headers and bounded concurrent delivery
- OAuth2, SAML, ACME, and identity-federation private keys are now decoded when configuration loads instead of at server start, surfacing a malformed key immediately rather than at the next restart

### Fixed

- Fixed contract start/end dates not being updatable

## [0.263.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Tracker attribution now judges third parties by data egress rather than code origin, catching vendor SDKs bundled into first-party code; artifacts belonging to a browser extension or other visitor-installed software are now marked `NOT_ATTRIBUTABLE` instead of first-party or a wrongly attributed vendor

### Changed

- Connecting Tally as an access review source now validates the API key at connect time and derives the organization id automatically; the connection probe and name resolver moved to the one Tally endpoint that accepts API-key auth, fixing every Tally connection reporting "credentials are invalid"
- The mapping worker no longer re-evaluates tracker writes already confirmed to come from a browser extension, since that evidence settles attribution on its own
- The `third_parties.common_third_party_id` index can now be built `CONCURRENTLY` ahead of a deploy; the migration is a no-op if the index already exists

### Fixed

- "Open in Probo" links from an access request and from Probot Slack notifications now land on the compliance portal's permissions page instead of a removed console route
- A tracker artifact could gain a vendor attribution after another worker had already settled it terminal (first-party / not-attributable); the terminal verdict now always wins
- The enrichment worker could re-process and re-attribute a tracker row that had already received a terminal verdict

## [0.262.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- authentik as an access review source, connected with an API-intent token and the instance URL. MFA status is derived from the instance's authenticator devices, and stays unknown rather than disabled when a device kind is unreadable
- Probot: a Slack bot that lets employees link their Slack identity to their Probo account (`/probot login`) and manage the link from their profile. Bound users get compliance review and approval notifications in Slack with per-item actions, and can drive Probo actions conversationally from a bound channel. Organizations manage the Slack install, channel, and identity bindings from Settings

### Changed

- **Operators running their own Asana OAuth app must switch it to "Full permissions" in the Asana developer console before upgrading.** Asana publishes no granular scope covering workspace memberships and rejects an authorize request that mixes `default` with granular scopes, so an app left on granular scopes refuses both new connections and reconnects. Existing Asana connectors keep their old grant and must be reconnected once
- Reorganized the console navigation into a two-level product rail and panel, replacing the flat sidebar. Settings now groups Organization, IAM (Users, Auth & Provisioning, Audit Log), Registries, and Webhooks; Access Reviews, Privacy (Processing Activities), Third-Party Risk Management, compliance portals, and cookie banners each get their own switcher or panel. Dark mode, which regressed during the rework, is restored
- Third-party and compliance-portal profile pages (Profile, Assurance, Stakeholders, branding) now save each field as it's edited (on blur) instead of via a page-level Save button
- Compliance portal review and tool actions now validate that the resource being acted on belongs to the access request, without blocking valid partial (per-item) approvals

### Fixed

- Asana access reviews failed to fetch any account. The workspace memberships endpoint the driver reads is reachable only with Asana's full `default` scope, so a connector granted `users:read` and `workspaces:read` connected successfully and then got 403 on every sync. Asana admin, guest and view-only flags now stay unknown when the API withholds them instead of being reported as false
- Fixed a crash when adding a new Statement of Applicability entry (the create mutation omitted maturity level)
- Long labels in risk analysis diagrams no longer get clipped: Mermaid flowchart and threat-hexagon labels wrap again after the Mermaid 11.13 upgrade dropped automatic wrapping
- Windows device posture (BitLocker protection, password policy, time-sync status) now reports correctly on non-English systems instead of showing Unknown

## [0.261.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- Updated Go dependencies to address a reported security vulnerability

## [0.261.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Compliance portals can now run behind an externally terminated TLS load balancer, keeping strict domain routing and HTTP redirects while skipping ACME setup and avoiding dead HTTPS ports in that mode

### Fixed

- CIMD clients skipping consent now require both a verified custom domain host and identity-only scopes (`openid`/`profile`/`email`), closing a gap that could grant broader API access without a consent screen
- Agent netcheck now blocks NAT64, 6to4, Teredo, and CGNAT address ranges, closing an IPv6 SSRF gap in the agent tool guard

## [0.260.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- MCP `listRiskMeasures` tool to list measures linked to a risk (reverse of `listMeasureRisks`), so callers can discover links to unlink before `deleteRisk`.
- Explicit likelihood/impact matrix size (3×3, 4×4, or 5×5) on risk analyses, across GraphQL, MCP, and the console
- Device enrollment now has a dedicated "Download the Probo agent" step linking to pro.bo/install before organization selection, skippable when the agent is already installed

### Changed

- OAuth consent and token screens now translate scope labels instead of showing raw English strings
- Devices list shows the last reported agent version, and the Windows OS version column now shows the short numeric version instead of the full localized banner

### Fixed

- Deleting a risk that still has linked measures, documents, or other references now returns a clear "resource is in use" error instead of an opaque internal error.
- Linking a measure to an existing task is no longer silently dropped on update

## [0.259.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- `COMPLIANCE_PORTAL_MANAGER` and `COMPLIANCE_PORTAL_ACCESS_MANAGER` membership roles, for delegating full compliance portal management or just visitor access approval without broader admin access
- AI Systems register: track an organization's AI system inventory with a dedicated backend, console UI, and publish flow, alongside CLI, MCP, and n8n surfaces
- Optional period start/end fields on risk analyses
- Cookie banner resource reporting switch, so operators can disable resource detection per banner while cookies and storage keep reporting normally

### Changed

- Compliance portal tabs a role cannot access now show a no-access state inline instead of being hidden, so the header and other tabs stay usable
- Cookie banner resource reporting and compliance portal rights requests are exposed through a nested `capabilities` object on GraphQL and MCP instead of separate flat boolean fields; the CLI, n8n node, console, and visitor portal follow. The browser-facing banner config keeps its flat `resource_reporting_enabled` key so already-released cookie banner SDKs keep working
- The person profile "Type" field is free text instead of a fixed set of options
- Document content JSON now allows up to 1 MiB, up from 500,000 bytes

### Fixed

- Evidence names are shown again as a separate column in measures, so linked and uploaded evidence stays identifiable when no generated description is available
- The vetting agent no longer overwrites a third party's countries

### Removed

- Dropped the unused `generateDocumentChangelog` mutation; the console publish flow already collects a changelog by hand

## [0.258.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Nuki access review integration: connect a Nuki account to review who can open which smart locks, with door grants, roles, last activity, and active state per person, and unlinked keypad codes and fobs surfaced as service accounts.

### Fixed

- Certificates of Completion now print `signed_at` at the same microsecond precision used to compute the seal, so the certificate's own Seal Verification procedure reproduces the digest instead of appearing to fail. Certificates generated before this change remain unverifiable by the printed procedure.
- Electronic signatures are rejected when the signer has no name, and compliance portal visitors without a full name are redirected to set one before they can sign the NDA instead of accepting it with a blank signature.
- Identity and membership profile names are trimmed when set, so whitespace-only names can no longer be stored.
- The console's Content-Security-Policy now allows Google favicons served from `*.gstatic.com`, and console schema validation no longer needs `eval`, so both work under the policy.
- Access review CSV sources accept multiple roles in the `role` column, separated by semicolons.

### Changed

- Access review admin status, MFA, and other provider signals distinguish unknown from false: values the source does not report, or reports in an unfamiliar form, now display as unknown instead of being shown as negative. Campaign entry rows and the additional-roles popover were reworked to present this consistently.
- Document content now allows up to 200,000 characters of text, up from 50,000.

## [0.257.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Console and compliance portal now send a Content-Security-Policy header, with a matching policy applied to their local Vite dev servers, restricting scripts, styles, and connections to known origins (including object storage, Google Fonts, Google favicons, and Markdown image sources), and hardened against configuration and origin injection.

### Fixed

- Clearing a person's contract end date now updates the people list immediately instead of only on the server, and the people list's actions column no longer starves date columns of space.

### Changed

- Cookie banner presentation now matches each jurisdiction's actual disclosure duties: Japan and jurisdictions with no cookie-consent law move to the opt-out layout instead of interrupting every visitor on load, Brazil (LGPD) requires prior opt-in, and a US visitor whose state cannot be resolved falls back to CCPA rather than no regulation. Only Mexico keeps the notice-on-load presentation.
- Opt-out button copy is split into a generic label and a California-specific statutory label, so the "Do Not Sell or Share" phrasing no longer appears outside US state privacy laws.

## [0.256.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- People list now shows each person's contract end date, making it easier to see why someone with an ended contract is excluded from document signatures despite still appearing active.

### Fixed

- Blank SCIM position/kind values are now treated as unset instead of failing person-form validation, and the people table's empty-state row spans the correct number of columns.
- Cookie banner tracker detection no longer aborts the whole batch when an SDK-reported cookie or storage key exceeds PostgreSQL's index size limit; oversized identifiers are capped at 255 bytes and dropped instead.
- The third-party compliance document agent now downloads PDFs directly instead of navigating to them, so PDF documents are read and verified correctly.

### Changed

- SCIM audit event writes no longer block the provisioning request, and are now bounded to a fixed duration.

## [0.255.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- SCIM audit events now store the request and response bodies exchanged with the provisioning client, with password fields and credential attributes redacted regardless of the schema URN used to reference them.

### Fixed

- The compliance portal's unsigned-NDA banner no longer appears before a visitor has requested access to a private document, and an admin-granted access no longer triggers it as if the visitor had requested access themselves.
- Locked document viewer CTA now names the NDA instead of reusing the banner's generic "Review and sign" label.
- Compliance portal mailing list update detail pages no longer 404.

## [0.254.0] - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Organization creation is now restricted to owners when signup is disabled.
- Console access is now restricted when the user has no organization membership.
- Risk analysis scopes are now referred to as diagrams across the API and console UI.

### Fixed

- Resolved npm audit vulnerabilities in `dompurify`, `js-yaml`, and `mermaid` dependencies.

## [0.253.0] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- Evidence uploads now display in the PDF viewer instead of a degraded fallback when the display mode was changed or the browser navigated away and back

## [0.252.0] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- Organization risk assessments are now named risk analyses across the database, console API, MCP API, CLI, and console UI. Third-party assessments and Statement of Applicability control flags keep their existing naming.
- Compliance portal document, audit, and subprocessor selection is reversed: the console now lists the organization's own documents, audits, and subprocessors with checkboxes for inline portal membership, replacing the portal-only rows plus separate add dialogs.
- Compliance portal catalog document, audit, and third-party rows are now exposed as Relay Nodes in the console API.

### Fixed

- Unchecking a compliance portal document no longer reports a remove error after the deletion actually succeeded.
- `probod` now persists its local ACME account key across restarts, so pending certificate orders no longer fail with 401 after a restart; unauthorized order polls now clear resumable state and retry provisioning instead of stalling.
- Compliance portal document table now spaces the alias and visibility controls instead of rendering them flush against each other.

## [0.251.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Compliance portal Requests surface (rights requests) can now be enabled or disabled per organization from the console overview; when disabled, the portal hides the nav item and treats `/requests` as not found.
- Document export watermarks now accept custom text instead of only an email address, with a 64-byte size limit and validation; existing `watermarkEmail` usage keeps working.
- Access review campaign entries can now be filtered by account status (Active, Disabled, Unknown), mirroring the existing MFA filter.

### Changed

- Portal "Get Access" CTA is now labeled "Request Access" throughout the TopBar and document flows.
- Access review campaign entries now show admin status as Yes/No text instead of a check/X icon, so admins stand out instead of non-admins looking flagged.

### Fixed

- Locked document viewer now shows the correct CTA — Sign NDA takes priority over Request Access when the portal NDA is incomplete — instead of always showing Get Access regardless of a pending request.
- Compliance portal asset URLs on nested routes (e.g. `/en/documents/...`) no longer resolve under the route path and serve HTML instead of the expected chunk.

## [0.250.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- HubSpot access-review connector now derives last login from successful events on the Account Activity login API (past 90 days). Existing HubSpot connectors must reconnect (or private apps must grant `account-info.security.read`) before last-login population works; missing scope leaves last login unset rather than failing the fetch.
- Access review campaign entries now show each account's authentication method (e.g. SSO or password), with a matching filter in the campaign toolbar.
- Obligations linked to a control now expose a total count in the console API.
- Mailing list subscribers and updates are now resolvable as GraphQL nodes in the console API.

### Fixed

- HubSpot access-review connector now marks deactivated/archived users as inactive by consulting the Owners API (`archived=true`) instead of treating every Settings Users row as active. Existing HubSpot connectors must reconnect (or private apps must grant `crm.objects.owners.read`) before inactive detection works.
- Closed an open-redirect bypass where a control byte (tab, newline, etc.) before a path segment could collapse to an off-origin protocol-relative URL, evading the fix for CVE-2026-49820.
- Access review campaign entries no longer silently truncate for sources with more than 500 entries; entries are now paginated instead of clamped to the API's page limit.
- Third-party business associate agreement, compliance report, and data privacy agreement resolvers now return the correct linked third party instead of erroring or resolving the wrong one.
- Creating a compliance portal reference without a logo file no longer fails; a default placeholder logo is used instead.
- The MCP `SendMailingListUpdateTool` now checks the send permission instead of the update permission.
- Evidence uploads now reject empty files, and evidence without an associated task no longer returns an internal server error.
- MCP-created tracker patterns now default to the script source instead of leaving it unset.

## [0.249.1] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Compliance portal PDF preview no longer fails to load when export/download still worked: the viewer worker is now bundled from the same pdf.js version as react-pdf

## [0.249.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Subdivision-aware geolocation: IP lookups now resolve an ISO 3166-2 subdivision alongside the country, and the resolved jurisdiction is persisted on consent records. Bundled country blocks are replaced by provider-neutral ranges so licensed importers can supply subdivision data
- US visitors are mapped to their own state privacy law (VCDPA, TDPSA, CPA, and so on) instead of being labeled CCPA. California keeps the statutory Privacy Choices experience; other mapped states use a generic opt-out banner with US-specific copy
- Canadian visitors are mapped per province: Quebec to Law 25, Alberta to PIPA_AB, and British Columbia to PIPA_BC, with PIPEDA retained elsewhere. Canadian opt-out banner copy applies to PIPEDA and provincial PIPA; `PIPA_CA` remains valid for legacy records
- `subdivisionCode` on the consent record list and detail pages, so operators can verify the detected jurisdiction

### Changed

- Vetting agent notes in the third-party register are parsed into structured document blocks instead of being embedded as raw Markdown, so headings, tables, and bold markers render correctly in generated documents and PDFs

### Fixed

- MS365 OAuth reconnects no longer appear incomplete: a refresh token is treated as `offline_access` even though Microsoft's v2 token response omits that scope
- A Markdown conversion failure in a single risk-assessment note no longer aborts the whole third-party register publish; the note falls back to a plain-text paragraph

## [0.248.0] - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- Restructured the access review console list UI: dedicated list item components for campaigns, sources, and entry sections; replaced the add-source dialog with the provider list flow; consolidated fetch-status UI, shared the campaign deletable-status helper, and now load remaining sources while searching so matches beyond the first page aren't missed

### Fixed

- Presigned S3 requests (`PresignGetObject`) no longer fail with a misleading "not found" error
- A failed page load during source search no longer hides "Load more", so later pages stay reachable

## [0.247.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Organizations can now track DORA Critical ICT Functions via a new Business Functions register — link assets, third parties, and people to a business function, with matching CLI, MCP, and n8n operations
- Dutch (nl-NL) language support extended to the compliance portal's documents, NDA, requests, subprocessors, and updates pages

### Changed

- Revamped the access review campaign bulk-decision UI: selection now survives partial and stale failures (retaining failed entries so bulk actions can be resubmitted), and accessibility and narrow-layout behavior were hardened

### Fixed

- Cloudflare access reviews are now scoped to a single account instead of merging members across every account reachable by the API token, which produced duplicate emails
- Asana access review roles and admin status are now populated from membership data instead of always showing empty
- Fixed the OpenAI connector probe endpoint
- Uploads to Google Cloud Storage's S3-interoperability endpoint no longer fail with `SignatureDoesNotMatch`; the SDK no longer signs the `Accept-Encoding` header, which GCS rewrites in transit
- Device codes are now kept for 15 minutes past expiry before garbage collection, so a client polling right at expiry gets `expired_token` instead of `invalid_grant`

## [0.246.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Cookie banners can now present a dedicated CCPA "Your Privacy Choices" panel (right to opt out of sale/sharing, right to limit sensitive personal information) and a first-class notice-only presentation for jurisdictions with no cookie-consent law, driven by an additive `layout` field in the banner config
- Consent records can now capture a distinct `ACKNOWLEDGE` action for notice-only banners instead of always recording an accept-all; exposed through GraphQL, MCP, the console consent-records view, and n8n
- MCP access review entries now include the campaign source name and connector ID, so agents no longer have to infer the source tool from account metadata

### Changed

- Generated tracker policy documents no longer show a "Last updated" timestamp in the body, since it churned on every automatic regeneration

### Fixed

- Dutch (nl-NL) cookie banner translations were missing the Privacy Choices panel copy and the notice dismiss label added after the nl-NL backfill; both are now included

## [0.245.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Dutch (nl-NL) language support across the console, compliance portal, and cookie banner
- MCP `tools/list` responses now include a cache TTL hint so well-behaved clients can skip refetching the static tool set every session

### Fixed

- The compliance portal subprocessor picker no longer lists non-top-level third parties; only level-one third parties can be selected as subprocessors
- Uploads to S3-compatible endpoints that don't support AWS's checksum extensions (e.g. Google Cloud Storage's S3-interop endpoint) no longer fail with a misleading `SignatureDoesNotMatch: Access denied` error when checksum calculation is explicitly configured

## [0.244.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Organizations can now operate multiple compliance portals: portal-scoped catalogs, access, visitor experience, and console management (including portal selection and catalog publication controls) replace the single organization-wide portal, with matching CLI, MCP, and n8n operations for managing portals and their audit, document, third-party, file, and reference catalogs. The legacy "trust center" terminology and database tables are renamed to "compliance portal" throughout.
- Deployments can now override compiled-in connector endpoints (e.g. to point a connector at a vendor's sandbox), validated at boot with SSRF-hardened checks — atomic per-provider overrides, host/scheme/credential validation, and pagination guarded against off-host or path-traversal redirection so a spoofed next-page link cannot exfiltrate a connection's bearer token
- Expose mailing lists, detected trackers, compliance portal frameworks, and document/control/framework mutations via MCP that were previously console-only

### Changed

- Third-party business and security owners are now migrated into a single shared administrators list across GraphQL, MCP, CLI, n8n, and the console
- Access review source rows now explain why a provider returned no organizations (app not approved, personal account, or provider without a picker) instead of always falling back to a free-text slug input
- Providers whose organization is captured during the OAuth callback (PagerDuty, Vercel, Datadog, Zendesk) now show it read-only instead of an editable slug input that always failed to save

### Fixed

- Access review connector rows now show which OAuth scopes are missing after a reconnect, instead of leaving "Reconnect required" unexplained
- Microsoft 365 access review no longer fails an entire source fetch when `AuditLog.Read.All` is unavailable on the tenant; affected accounts import with MFA left unknown instead
- Linear connector errors no longer echo the provider's raw error message, which could leak tenant identifiers or query fragments
- A source with a missing or deleted connector is no longer reported the same way as a provider that legitimately returned no organizations
- Long process names on risk assessment Mermaid flowchart edges no longer get clipped to a single line
- Compliance portal document filtering is now consistent across the catalog, access, and visitor services

## [0.243.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- ITAM devices are now exposed via MCP and n8n (in addition to GraphQL): list, get, create, revoke, delete, and set-owner, with latest postures nested on list/get responses

### Changed

- Compliance portal locale-mismatch banner now falls back to a supported browser-language match for visitors without a saved locale, and stays silent for unsupported languages instead of assuming English is preferred

### Fixed

- Manual agent install instructions now point to `probo-agent/v*` releases instead of the repo-wide `/releases/latest`, which pointed at the wrong assets when other tracks published more recently
- SCIM event CSV exports no longer fail with a "cannot parse address" error caused by a missing email address in the underlying membership profile query

## [0.242.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Organization owners and admins can now delete the organization's horizontal logo; the underlying file is soft-deleted so existing download URLs stop serving the image, and the operation is exposed in the n8n organization node
- Compliance portal shows an unsigned-NDA banner directly in the portal shell, with a "Sign" CTA and a Documents back link on the NDA page, instead of only surfacing the requirement when a document export fails
- Access-review connector rows show a "reconnect" prompt when the connector needs additional OAuth scopes
- Devices can now be soft-deleted after being revoked; ITAM garbage collection also hard-deletes orphaned pending/revoked devices with no API key, postures, or valid enrollment token

### Changed

- NDA signature is now required only for exporting a private (protected) document, report, or file — requesting access and exporting public files no longer require signing first
- Locale-mismatch and unsigned-NDA banners in the compliance portal are now visually distinguished (info vs warning) so they don't read as a single band when both are shown
- MCP third-party list now defaults to level 1 (direct third parties only) when no level filter is given
- Document signing/approval reminders due on a weekend now defer to Monday instead of sending over the weekend or spending an escalation step unused

### Fixed

- Microsoft 365 access review lists home-tenant organization members only, using the same Graph `/users?$filter=userType eq 'Member'` call as the SCIM bridge
- Microsoft 365 access review now resolves actual MFA status for users instead of always reporting it as unknown
- Portal mutations now consistently enforce sign-in, full-name, and NDA gates instead of relying on each call site to reimplement the redirect logic
- Guests who sign in from a shared-locale portal link no longer land back on it showing a stale locale-mismatch banner; the redirect now adopts the identity's saved locale
- ITAM GraphQL actions are now registered under the `v1:itam`/`v1:itam:read` OAuth2 scopes, fixing bearer-token callers that were failing closed despite having role-level permission
- Device enrollment token deletes are now scoped to the owning tenant
- SCIM audit-log CSV exports collected by ID no longer fail to load activation/deactivation timestamps

## [0.241.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- MCP tools now carry titles and complete annotation hints (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`) so clients like Claude present reads, writes, and deletes accurately

### Changed

- Member profiles now have a `PENDING` state distinct from `ACTIVE`/`DEACTIVATED`, so invited-but-not-yet-activated members remain assignable to assets, data, and risks; owner pickers and state filters across the console, CLI, MCP, and n8n now accept multiple states
- "Archive" user action renamed to "Deactivate" across the API, CLI, MCP, n8n, and console
- People list status filter is now a multi-select dropdown instead of cramped checkboxes, and reflects `PENDING` immediately after an activation email is sent
- Audit log and SCIM export CSV files now escape leading `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab, and carriage-return characters to prevent spreadsheet formula injection

### Fixed

- Asset table's inline owner picker no longer offers deactivated profiles as owners
- People list search no longer briefly reverts to stale results when a debounced search resolves after a filter change
- Disabled dropdown checkbox items are now fully non-interactive (opacity, cursor, hover) instead of only dimming the checkbox glyph

## [0.240.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Log export for audit logs and SCIM events: request a CSV export job from the console, Connect, MCP, or CLI, streamed and uploaded to S3 by a concurrent export worker
- Auth cookie `SameSite` attribute is now configurable (`PROBOD_AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE`, defaults to `Lax`), rejecting `None` unless `Secure` is enabled
- In-tab light/dark display mode toggle for signed-in compliance portal guests, independent of the OS color scheme
- Subprocessor cards truncate long country/region lists behind a "+N" popover

### Changed

- Access review campaigns can now be deleted in any status, except while a campaign is still fetching sources
- Document share action relabeled "Copy link" and exposed on each row of the documents list, not just the viewer
- Locked document viewer keeps showing the document title and an access-request CTA instead of withholding the whole page
- Guest language selector shows the locale code instead of the full language name to save space next to "Get access"
- Compliance portal TopBar stacks the brand name over the tagline and shortens nav labels on narrower viewports
- html2pdf-rendered PDFs (e.g. signature certificates) now request a tagged structure tree and document outline from Chrome for accessibility
- `safeRedirect` now accepts configured CORS origins as valid continue-URL hosts, alongside verified custom domains

### Fixed

- Document soft-delete now clears associated control/risk/measure mappings, fixing risk deletion when the linked document was already removed
- Console document `lang` attribute now follows the active i18next locale instead of always reporting English
- "Trusted by" logo tiles now stretch to match row height when a caption wraps to two lines
- Compliance portal drawer's dropdown/select menus are clickable again when the swipe drawer's transform was blocking pointer events underneath it
- Ukrainian "+N more regions" label now uses the correct one/few/many plural forms

## [0.239.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Device page shows a formatted value per posture check alongside current postures; the Postures tab is replaced with paginated report history grouped by agent push time

## [0.238.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Optional `auditStartDate`/`auditEndDate` on audits, exposed through GraphQL, MCP, CLI, n8n, and console, with new sortable order fields `AUDIT_START_DATE`/`AUDIT_END_DATE`

### Fixed

- Unverified password identities could open a session after signing out; password sign-in is now rejected with `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` until the address is confirmed, with a resend-confirmation email flow
- Completing a magic link for an existing identity now marks the address verified, matching OIDC behavior
- Mermaid diagrams that fail to render now show a toast with a safe inline fallback instead of leaking raw Mermaid error markup into documents

## [0.237.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Compliance portal documents page supports bulk requesting access: select several locked documents, reports, or files and request access to all of them in one call
- `updateAccessReviewCampaign` now accepts `accessReviewSourceIds` to sync a campaign's scope sources alongside other updates in the same call
- People list gained search and status/role/type filters across GraphQL, MCP, and CLI, with the default page size raised to 100
- Third-party selector fields on measures and other forms now show only first-level third parties

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash on the third-party detail page when a third party's country was set to the global pseudo-region
- Empty toast viewport no longer blocks pointer events (hover/click) over content underneath it, such as bottom action bar buttons

### Security

- Bumped `postcss` to 8.5.23 and `react-router` to 8.3.0 to remediate high-severity npm audit findings

## [0.236.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Five new access-review connectors: Google Analytics (GA4), Dotfile, Segment, Square, and UpCloud, with account listing, role/status resolution, and connector logos
- French translation for the console and compliance portal, backed by a new `react-i18next` setup
- Documentation links for the Dotfile, Segment, and 19 other API-key access-review connectors' setup dialogs
- Restored the "Risk Accepted" status on finding create/update forms, with a searchable paginated risk picker to supply the required linked risk

### Fixed

- Preserve the post-login destination through OIDC, magic-link, and SAML auth-error redirects instead of dropping it on `/auth/error`
- Custom-domain CNAME verification no longer fails on multi-hop DNS alias chains
- 1Password and Langfuse access-review connectors could not be connected: required extra settings (SCIM bridge URL, base URL) were silently dropped by the console

## [0.235.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Device management: enroll employee devices via the new `probo-agent`, view posture and admin the device fleet with owner assignment from the console, and let employees confirm enrollment and check their own device status without an assumed session
- "Documentation" links for connector setup: the API-key connect dialog and access-review Add Source dialog now link to a connector's docs page when available

### Changed

- Renamed the "My Signatures" console menu item to "Employee Portal"
- Auth failures (SAML, OIDC, magic-link) now redirect to a shared `/auth/error` page with a stable error code and a clear explanation instead of raw JSON or one-off pages; SAML failures always show a generic reason to avoid leaking account or org state

### Fixed

- Hardened custom-domain verification: CNAME/TXT checks now require the record owner to match the verified hostname, and CAA checks climb to the registrable domain and validate RFC 8659 syntax, closing a bypass where an apex record could satisfy verification for a subdomain
- Third-party category is no longer reset to "Other" when omitted from a partial update via MCP, GraphQL, or CLI

## [0.234.0] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- Render longer vetting notes as markdown, keeping more of the orchestrator assessment text and skipping profile fields already on the third party

### Fixed

- Reject empty SAML NameIDs during assertion validation, preventing duplicate-key failures on later logins, and return a clear error when a NameID is already linked to another account
- Require portal redirect hosts to have a verified certificate (Active/Renewing) before allowing OIDC, magic-link, and compliance-portal OAuth `continue` redirects, closing an open redirect on newly claimed custom domains
- Fixed PostHog access-review sources being marked disconnected for EU cloud OAuth tokens by delegating region discovery to the shared resolver used by the access-review driver

## [0.233.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Added pointer parallax to logo backdrops (`MediaTile`/`BackdropCard`), with eased entry and a frozen pose when the pointer leaves

### Fixed

- Split certificate provisioning into separate begin-challenge and poll-order workers so the global ACME rate-limit cooldown no longer blocks polling of in-flight orders
- Fixed several access-review connector defects that silently synced zero users or hammered vendor APIs (Sentry trailing-slash routing, Vercel OAuth team parameter, Brex company-read scope, Cloudflare `per_page` floor, picker providers now auto-select their first workspace, org defaulting now also applied via MCP, and the source-name worker no longer re-claims permanently-failed sources or loses a resolved name after reconnect)

### Removed

- Disabled the Clerk access-review connector: its Backend API only exposes application end-users, not workspace admins, so reviews targeted the wrong population

## [0.232.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Exposed a gauge for the ACME rate-limit cooldown end time (`certmanager_certificate_acme_cooldown_until_timestamp_seconds`) and expanded provisioning failure logs with the full ACME error detail (status code, instance, link, subproblems, retry-after), making cooldowns and CA errors diagnosable

## [0.231.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Compliance portal URLs are now locale-prefixed (e.g. `/fr/documents`), with self-canonical and hreflang SEO tags and a persisted identity locale that reconciles the browser locale against a saved preference via a mismatch banner

### Changed

- Compliance portal home page now shows a short entity name instead of the full portal title as its heading (API field renamed `title` -> `entityName`), restoring the localized hero composition and using the entity name as the OAuth client name

### Fixed

- Hardened automatic TLS certificate provisioning: fixed several race conditions and correctness gaps in the ACME worker (challenge acceptance ordering, write-back locking, Retry-After parsing, stale-order reset scoping, poll lease sizing, CAA error classification, and duplicate metrics registration) that could leave certificates stuck, unissued, or crash the provisioning worker

## [0.230.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Webhook events now include `RIGHT_REQUEST_CREATED`, `RIGHT_REQUEST_UPDATED`, and `RIGHT_REQUEST_DELETED` for rights requests created via console or compliance portal
- Compliance portal visitors can now sign in via OAuth/OIDC, with sign-in and consent screens showing the requesting client's branding (logo and name)
- Compliance portal home page now displays the full custom portal title as its heading, instead of composing it from the organization name
- Added a configurable trust center base domain (default `probopage.com`) so a managed default domain and certificate are provisioned for every compliance portal at organization creation

### Changed

- Renamed "Trust Center" to "Compliance Portal" across the GraphQL API and MCP tools — notably `ComplianceExternalURL` is now `ComplianceCustomLink` and the visibility field is `compliancePortalVisibility`
- Moved public-facing profile fields (title, description, website, email, headquarters address) off the organization and onto the compliance portal
- Custom domains and their certificates now belong to the compliance portal rather than the whole organization, with issuance and renewal handled by a dedicated poll-based worker
- Console: restructured the brand page into profile, domains, visual identity, and custom link sections, and moved frameworks and the NDA card onto the overview page

### Removed

- Removed the one-time session-transfer authentication flow for custom-domain SSO cookies, now that portal visitors authenticate via OAuth

## [0.229.1] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Mapped commitment and commitment group actions to the `v1:compliance-page` OAuth2 scope so tokens with that scope can create and manage commitments via MCP/API

## [0.229.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- MCP commitment and commitment group tools (create, list, update, delete) so automation can manage compliance portal commitments end to end

### Changed

- Redirect the legacy compliance portal `/overview` URL to home
- Introduced a v2 z-index scale so portaled menus and popups sit above in-page media

### Fixed

- Aligned the compliance portal PDF preview and desktop gutter with the page header, and matched list skeletons to the card surface

## [0.228.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- The compliance portal is now served in production for the `/trust` path and custom-domain sites, replacing the previous trust center frontend
- Added Data Requests pages to the compliance portal: data subjects can submit and track GDPR/CCPA rights requests (including rectification, objection, and complaint types) after magic-link sign-in, scoped to their verified email
- Added subscribe-to-updates in the compliance portal, with an Updates CTA and a sign-out action in the user menu
- Added eleven new compliance-portal locales: German, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Simplified Chinese

### Changed

- Renamed the document approval button to "Approve" and updated the consent text to match, since the action only approves
- Made the compliance portal layout responsive
- Standardized copy to say "compliance portal" instead of "trust center" throughout

### Fixed

- Fixed document row accessibility for mobile screen readers and corrected PDF page sync after fit-to-width reflow
- Preserved `Field` `aria-describedby` when showing form errors

## [0.227.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Added a Trust Center documents page with category grouping, a Public/Private visibility filter, and a full document viewer for PDFs, images, and other file downloads
- Added configurable, reorderable commitment cards to the compliance portal home page, replacing the hardcoded placeholder content
- Added a sign-in dialog (magic link + OIDC) that gates trust-center access requests

### Changed

- Renamed risk overview labels for consistency: "Severity" to "Score" and "Inherent" to "Initial"
- Archiving a document now voids pending approval quorums and cancels requested signatures instead of leaving them dangling

### Fixed

- Fixed an ambiguous tenant filter that caused signature load queries to fail

## [0.226.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Updated `golang.org/x/text` to v0.39.0 to remediate CVE-2026-56852

## [0.226.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Added a v2 `ErrorBoundary` component (with companion `ErrorState` and `InlineError` primitives) to `@probo/ui` for graceful React error handling
- Webhook deliveries for `*:updated` events now include a top-level `updatedFrom` field alongside `data`, carrying a full snapshot of the entity as it was before the update (e.g. the prior membership role on `user:updated`). The field is omitted for non-update events

### Fixed

- SCIM user provisioning: deleting a user whose profile is still referenced (e.g. by signed document versions) now archives the user instead of returning a 500 and disabling the connector

## [0.225.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Added managed access-review connectors for Scaleway, Yousign, Railway, and Crisp, including provider logos and website/ownership verification before a connection is established; managed connectors stay hidden until they are fully configured
- Added server-side filtering for trust center subprocessors, exposing facet-driven filters through the trust API
- Added trust center Updates list and detail pages with pagination and a mailing-list subscribe action
- Added a Risk Assessments tab to the risks list page in the console

### Changed

- The OAuth2 consent page now shows a submit loader and a redirect screen after the user grants consent

### Fixed

- Microsoft OIDC sign-in now requires verified domain ownership before linking an account

## [0.224.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Built with Go 1.26.5 (up from 1.26.4) to pick up the standard-library security fixes for CVE-2026-42505 (ECH handshake de-anonymization) and CVE-2026-39822 (`os.Root` symlink following on Unix)

## [0.224.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Added FERPA and PCI DSS framework datasets (controls and logos), selectable in the framework import selector alongside the existing frameworks

### Changed

- Consolidated ownership-grant authorization into policy: granting OWNER (via `createUser` or `updateMembership`) is now restricted to organization owners through role-scoped allow policies conditioned on the assigned role, replacing the per-resolver custom checks and the now-removed `iam:membership-role:set-owner` action. The `permission` field gained an optional generic `attributes` key/value argument so the console can refine dry-run checks (e.g. by target role) without loosening the base grants
- Renamed the `DocumentVersionSignatureFilter` `state` field to `profileState` (GraphQL) / `profile_state` (MCP) to disambiguate it from the signature `states` field, since it filters on the signatory's profile state

### Fixed

- Enforced owner-only member removal: `removeUser` (API resolver and MCP `RemoveUserTool`) now requires the owner-only `iam:membership:delete` gate instead of the weaker `iam:membership-profile:delete`, so an organization ADMIN can no longer remove members (including OWNERs)
- Fixed a hole (GHSA-22xj-f767-ppw6) where a self-provisioned trust center visitor could accept or inject audit-trail events into another visitor's NDA signature by supplying its ID; esign now verifies signature ownership against the verified session identity in the accept and record-event flows
- Confined all public trust API reads and electronic-signature operations to the requesting compliance page's tenant, closing a cross-tenant access gap where a visitor could resolve nodes, export audit-report PDFs, and read or mutate signatures belonging to another organization
- Guarded the third-party vetting agent's HTTP tools against SSRF: outbound requests now route through an SSRF-protected client that rejects loopback, private, CGNAT, link-local, and reserved addresses on every redirect hop
- Excluded documents with no published version from the trust center "Grant All" available-access list so it matches the request-all filter and Slack notification
- Hid draft and hidden documents from the trust center access-request Slack notification so it only lists documents a requester could actually be granted
- Fixed Anthropic thinking budgets so `budget_tokens` stays below `max_tokens`; thinking is now omitted when the configured budget is too small to meet Anthropic's minimum

## [0.223.3] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Fixed IP address recording for NDA acceptance, document signing/approval events, and session creation behind a layer-7 proxy; affected endpoints now read the real client IP from `Forwarded` / `X-Forwarded-For` headers

## [0.223.2] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- Fixed a privilege-escalation gap where an organization ADMIN could mint an OWNER membership through `createUser`, bypassing the owner-only authorization enforced elsewhere; `createUser` (both the API resolver and the MCP `CreateUserTool`) now requires set-owner authorization when the requested role is OWNER

## [0.223.1] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- Fixed a cross-tenant IDOR where a Finding's linked Risk or a Processing Activity's Data Protection Officer could disclose another organization's data (GHSA-c74x-79w6-63jh): affected resolvers now authorize the referenced object itself instead of its parent, and the write paths validate the reference against the caller's organization

## [0.223.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Served files now support HTTP range requests, enabling seeking and resumable downloads
- Document lifecycle webhook events (`document.*`, including the `version`, `signature`, and `approval` sub-events) can now be subscribed to

### Changed

- Public files are served from a stable URL so CDN infrastructure can cache them properly
- Compliance report upload limit raised to 30MB
- OAuth token and consent UIs now display friendly names for the `v1:resource-alias` scopes instead of the raw scope string

### Fixed

- Compliance page no longer treats every Slack connector as connected
- Long Mermaid flowchart labels now wrap instead of being clipped in risk assessment diagrams
- Dialogs no longer close when dismissing a nested dropdown or select whose pointer lands inside the dialog, preserving form state

## [0.222.2] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- Bootstrap config output now omits empty fields and unset LLM provider blocks, producing cleaner generated YAML

## [0.222.1] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- String configuration defaults now come from `probod`'s built-in values when the corresponding environment variable is unset, ensuring bootstrap-generated and directly-configured deployments use the same defaults

## [0.222.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- OAuth2 loopback redirect URIs now match regardless of port, enabling native OAuth clients such as Claude Code that use ephemeral ports at authorization time (RFC 8252 section 7.3)
- Access review campaigns can now be closed when entries are in a failed state

### Changed

- Third-party risk assessment vetting notes now persist the full structured breakdown (risk classification, per-category analysis, privacy and data-processing practices, AI governance, contractual clauses, professional standing) instead of a short summary only

### Fixed

- Deleting a user still referenced elsewhere (e.g. as an asset owner) now returns a 409 Conflict instead of an internal error
- GraphQL endpoint is now protected against alias-flooding DoS (GHSA-prh2-g8pv-m7p9): parser token limit, field complexity cap, LRU query cache, and field suggestion suppression added to all three GraphQL handlers

### Removed

- Access review campaigns no longer expose a framework-controls field
- `pendingEntryCount` field removed from access review campaigns

## [0.221.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Compliance portal home page sections
- v2 UI component library: Text, Heading, Avatar, Button, IconButton, Badge, Callout, Dropdown menu, Card, Anchor, and Link components
- Webhook sender now runs on the kit worker framework

## [0.220.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Four new API-key access-review connectors: Pylon, OpenRouter, incident.io, and Brevo

### Fixed

- Advertised scopes for OAuth2 protected resources

## [0.219.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- DocuSign partner OAuth2 with PKCE: full authorization-code flow with account picker; the selected account is persisted and its data-center base URI resolved from /oauth/userinfo
- Five new API-key access-review connectors: Mercury, Apollo.io, Deepgram, ClickHouse Cloud, and Langfuse
- APIKeyBasicAuthUserPass auth mode for API-key connectors supporting username:password credentials
- Read actions on all unprefixed OAuth scopes

### Changed

- Pending signature requests on a superseded version are moved to the newly published minor version, preserving the notification schedule

### Fixed

- Signature requests are now restricted to the current published version
- Heroku connection probe sends the versioned `Accept: application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3` header, correctly detecting revoked tokens
- Third party assessment header display

## [0.218.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Bump `golang.org/x/image` to v0.43.0, remediating CVE-2026-33813 (denial of service via malformed WEBP parsing) and CVE-2026-46602 (missing tile-size limit in `x/image/tiff`)

## [0.218.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- RFC 6750 `WWW-Authenticate` challenges on OAuth bearer APIs (MCP, Console and Connect GraphQL, Files, OAuth2 userinfo): responses now advertise `resource_metadata`, `invalid_token`, and `insufficient_scope` with the required scopes

## [0.217.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Resource aliases: trust center entries support a custom URL slug; alias field and set/remove mutations exposed in the console API, trust API, and MCP tools, with alias-based navigation in the trust center

### Changed

- Agent tool JSON schemas normalize required fields for OpenAI compatibility

### Fixed

- Alias resolver, field blur, and sitemap URL generation

## [0.216.1] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- OAuth2 scope registration for CIMD client identifiers was missing; CIMD actions are now correctly gated by their corresponding scopes

## [0.216.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- OAuth2 Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD) support: MCP connectors such as ChatGPT and Claude can now register via HTTPS client_id URLs instead of pre-provisioned GIDs; metadata documents are fetched and cached, clients are upserted on first use, and CIMD is advertised in OIDC discovery when allowed URLs are configured

## [0.215.1] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Tracker-mapping no longer reprocesses sibling patterns O(N^2) times per banner; the re-enqueue now skips siblings already linked to a common third party or marked first-party, and routine mapping logs are demoted from INFO to Debug

## [0.215.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Tracker pattern category is now editable from the pattern detail page (matching the table-row behaviour)
- Trackers page filter now offers the HTTP cookie source, and extension-sourced rows render a proper source badge

### Changed

- Local storage, IndexedDB, and cache-storage trackers without an expiry now display as "persistent" rather than "session"

### Fixed

- Fixed a deadlock between concurrent tracker-mapping workers processing sibling patterns on the same banner
- An HTTP server-set cookie now outranks a pre-existing detection, re-arming mapping so the pattern is identified instead of being skipped

## [0.214.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- OAuth2 API scope enforcement: v1:* scopes registered and advertised in OIDC discovery and protected-resource metadata, enforced in the IAM authorizer before policy evaluation
- Identity-scoped OAuth token management: users can create, list, and revoke manual bearer tokens from `/me/oauth-tokens` and the console UI
- Auditor role now includes the `v1:iam:read` scope

### Changed

- OAuth consent screen groups API scopes under an accordion

### Fixed

- MCP API now accepts OAuth bearer tokens (was previously rejected)
- Notifications are skipped for inactive users

## [0.213.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Tracker-pattern catalog rows now carry a terminal attribution verdict (UNDETERMINED, THIRD_PARTY, FIRST_PARTY); FIRST_PARTY short-circuits the mapping pipeline so first-party and generic artifacts are never re-attributed

### Changed

- Document signing and approval emails are now batched per recipient by a debounced worker that sends one consolidated email and widening reminders, replacing the immediate per-document approval email and the manual "send signing notifications" action
- Deterministic vendor adoption in tracker mapping is gated behind a confidence/trust bar; lower-confidence rows are reused as hints and re-confirmed by an independent agent, and attributions must cite concrete evidence

### Fixed

- Tracker-pattern attribution is kept consistent with the vendor link: a first-party reclassification clears the stale org vendor link, and FIRST_PARTY rows are excluded from the enrichment requeue

## [0.212.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- OIDC authentication now opens a child session when assuming an organization

### Fixed

- OIDC organization access errors now return a 404 instead of an internal error

## [0.211.2] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Exit codes

## [0.211.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Missing OS exit code on error

## [0.211.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Document delete confirmation dialog in the console

### Changed

- Error responses during a server panic are now always serialized as JSON
- Enrichment tracking unified with outcome-based status; enrichment state, attempts, and run outcome now recorded per field

### Fixed

- Enrichment re-arm and migration backfill gaps corrected
- Google Workspace access review source-name resolution no longer loops on 403 responses

## [0.210.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Electronic signature on employee document signings: the signed PDF is generated and an esign record is created and accepted (capturing signer IP and user agent), mirroring the document approval flow; consent wording is now a single backend source of truth rendered consistently across the signing, approval, and NDA pages
- Structured authorization decision logging: every authorizer evaluation (allow, deny, no_match, assumption error) emits a decision line with policy id and reason using opaque ids

### Changed

- Access review campaign sources reworked: sources are first-class with a per-campaign snapshot (name, connector) taken at start time, fetch attempts recorded as an append-only log, the unused source category removed, and the deleted-source badge dropped from the campaign detail
- Access review roles render as up to three badges with a "+X more" popover instead of one long comma-separated string

### Fixed

- Access review connection status now probes all providers (static, dynamic, and custom) so bad API keys and expired OAuth tokens no longer show as Connected
- Cursor access review driver marks an account inactive when either `isRemoved` or role `removed` is set, fixing accounts reported active despite removal
- MCP profile output no longer fails schema validation when a profile has no additional email addresses

## [0.209.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Common third-party enricher worker that fills the global catalog (legal name, headquarters, canonical website, compliance docs, certifications, logo, owned domains) with per-field provenance and confidence thresholds; opt-in, no-ops without an agent provider
- Tracker mapping and common-pattern enrichment agents can now open pages with a read-only headless browser (gated on Chrome endpoint) to read setters from cookie-database and policy pages
- Discovery and persistence of common third-party owned domains, used to re-resolve previously unmapped tracker patterns
- `Cache-Control` and `ETag` on `/api/files/v1/static` brand assets; startup validation of required assets

### Changed

- Tracker enrichment agent now restates source-page descriptions in its own words rather than copying them verbatim
- Common third-party enrichment agents run in parallel after website resolution; prompts rewritten in role/task/instructions XML style with a calibrated confidence rubric
- Oversized logo responses are rejected instead of truncated; ownership substring matching tightened with a length-ratio guard; per-agent error text sanitized and bounded before persistence

### Fixed

- Activate-login path
- `find_links_matching` browser tool double-encoded its pattern, starving any agent using it
- Worker confidence threshold of `0` no longer dropped by Helm falsy-numeric truthiness

## [0.208.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Trust center file creation in console
- S3 filename header escaping

## [0.208.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- `active` status field on access entries
- Import action for catalog vendors in trackers; `importThirdPartyFromCommon`
  mutation to pull a catalog vendor into an org
- Catalog vendors surfaced in tracker policy documents
- File download URLs for console file fields

### Changed

- Trust and MCP connector logos now use the File type
- Third parties deduplicated by name; unique index enforced per org
- Tracker mapping no longer auto-creates org third parties; explicit import required
- Tracker row and category select restyled; move-to-category confirm dialog removed
- Tracker mapping restored to link existing patterns; "create only" mode removed
- Document major version publishing requires explicit `approver_ids`
- References updated to probo.com

### Removed

- Third-party disambiguation agent and automatic matching removed

### Fixed

- DNS TXT lookup retried over TCP on truncated UDP response

## [0.207.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Neon access-review connector (organization members via Neon API, API-key auth)
- Render access-review connector (workspace members, API-key + Workspace ID)
- Qovery access-review connector (organization members, configurable `Token` Authorization scheme)
- API-key connector providers can now declare a custom Authorization token scheme (defaults to `Bearer`)
- `regulationSource` (`DETECTED`/`DEFAULT`) on cookie consent records, with GDPR/OPT_IN applied as the safe default when geolocation does not resolve a known regulation
- `--keyword` scoping on the banner tracker-reset operator path: rebuilds only patterns whose pattern or display name contains the substring
- `parent_third_party_id` foreign key on third parties for arbitrary sub-third-party nesting depth; `level` (int, 1+) replaces the `firstLevel` boolean

### Changed

- Tracker-mapping agent ignores cookie-database/consent-directory operators (Cookipedia, cookiedatabase.org, CookieServe, …) as vendor attributions; CMP own-cookie attributions (OneTrust, Cookiebot, …) still survive
- Tracker-mapping agent ignores own-domain tracker attributions (patterns embedding the scanned site's own eTLD+1) with a deterministic backstop
- Relinking a common tracker pattern to a different third party now updates the confidence on linked org patterns
- Rename console label "Detected Count" to "Distinct Trackers Detected"
- `proboctl common-tracker-pattern reenrich` now accepts catalog-wide filters with no selection anchor (e.g. `--without-description` re-enriches every pattern lacking a description)

### Fixed

- Null out stale `initiator_url`/`initiator_domain` rows on `detected_trackers` that point at the @probo/cookie-banner bundle, so genuine third-party initiators repopulate on next detection
- Cookie-database denylist now matches domain and URL forms (e.g. `cookiedatabase.org`, `https://www.cookiepedia.co.uk/list`), not just bare brand names

### Removed

- `createThirdPartyThirdPartyMapping` and `deleteThirdPartyThirdPartyMapping` mutations and MCP tools; create a child third party by passing `parentThirdPartyId` on `createThirdParty`

## [0.206.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- `RiskAssessmentBoundary` first-class entity to group nodes within a risk assessment scope, with self-nesting parent boundary, scope-membership validation, nested-subgraph Mermaid rendering, and dedicated IAM actions
- `regenerateCookieBannerTrackerPolicy` mutation/MCP tool to re-trigger tracker policy generation on a banner that already has a published version, gated by a dedicated `regenerate-policy` action
- Better Stack access-review connector (Uptime API team members + pending invitations)
- SigNoz access-review connector (organization members, region/tenant or self-hosted base URL)
- `commonTrackerPatternId` field on `TrackerPattern` to indicate whether a pattern is linked to the global common-tracker catalog
- Files API: public endpoint `GET /api/files/v1/public/{fileID}` (unauthenticated, public files only) and private endpoint `GET /api/files/v1/{fileID}` (session/API key/OAuth2, `core:file:get` enforced); IAM and not-found errors both return 404
- Static brand assets served via `/api/files/v1/static` instead of S3

### Changed

- Connector provider infos promoted from `Organization.connectorProviderInfos` to a root-level `accessReviewDrivers` query, listable by any authenticated identity
- Tracker-mapping, common-pattern enrichment, and third-party disambiguation agents each get their own config (own timeout, own max-turns, own optional provider slot, with fallback to the tracker-mapping slot when unset)
- Console: tracker pages now surface common-tracker/third-party links with a "common" badge and updated pattern properties display

### Fixed

- Cookie tracker pattern analysis: removed unused sync re-enrich path and tightened reset/remap scoping

### Removed

- `ActionFileDownloadUrl` (replaced by `ActionFileGet`) and the standalone `pkg/filesign` package (folded into `file.Service`)

## [0.205.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- `submitAgentRunApproval` mutation to merge human approval decisions into an interrupted agent run and resume it
- Suspendable agent-tool subtrees: nested agent runs can now checkpoint and restore across multi-level tool calls

### Changed

- Agent-run worker no longer relies on leases and heartbeats: a graceful suspend returns the run to `PENDING`, an approval interruption parks it in `AWAITING_APPROVAL`, and crashed runs are left `RUNNING` for manual recovery
- AWS credentials now resolve through the full standard AWS SDK credential chain

### Fixed

- Auditors can now read the organization context and see the Context page in the console
- NDA upload now correctly sets the organization ID
- Logo updates no longer wipe unspecified fields on partial update
- Cookie tracker pattern analysis now splits on `:` and `.` so UUID-bearing keys collapse to a single template

## [0.204.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Dedicated error page when a magic link has already been used

### Changed

No user-facing changes; tag-only release.

## [0.202.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Add async third-party vetting worker with PENDING/PROCESSING/COMPLETED/FAILED states, exposed through GraphQL and MCP; the third-party detail page polls while vetting runs

## [0.193.1] - 2026-05-26

### Security

- Fix open redirect bypass in safe redirect

## [0.193.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Add measure ↔ third-party many-to-many link with tabs on both detail pages
- Add self-referential third-party relations with a `first_level` filter on the third-party list
- Track source on detected storage trackers (localStorage, sessionStorage, indexedDB, cacheStorage)

### Fixed

- Fix timing attack on signin
- Reject separator-only glob templates (e.g. `__*`) in tracker pattern analysis

## [0.192.0] - 2026-05-25

### Changed

- Enforce IAM authorization on all console resolvers — every data-bearing field now goes through the policy engine and produces an audit log entry; adds `ActionCommonThirdPartyGet`, `ActionCommonThirdPartyList`, and `ActionElectronicSignatureGet` actions wired into Viewer and Auditor policies

### Fixed

- Fix signature count mismatch between the document version badge and the signatures tab — both now filter by `activeContract: true` and `state: ACTIVE`, so deactivated signers and ended-contract signers are consistently excluded
- Fix MCP server resolvers after the signature filter and authorization changes

## [0.191.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Add a tracker pattern detail page in the console with a properties section and a list of detected tracker resources

### Fixed

- Strip empty ProseMirror text nodes from third-party list documents (and migrate existing `document_versions.content` to drop them) so Tiptap renders them instead of erroring with "Empty text nodes are not allowed"
- Tailor signature certificate email copy for document approvals — store the per-signature email subject on creation so the certificate worker uses "Your approved <Title> - Certificate of Completion" for approvals and the existing default for other flows
- Return a CONFLICT error instead of an opaque Internal error when deleting a membership profile that is still referenced as owner, approver, or assignee, by detecting the Postgres foreign-key violation in the coredata Delete path
- Always instantiate the coredata `CookieCategoryFilter` in the cookie banner queries to avoid nil-pointer risks

## [0.190.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Fix the snapshot-cleanup migration to delete from `processing_activity_third_parties` (the table was renamed from `processing_activity_vendors` in 0.189.0), so the migration runs on databases upgraded past the rename

## [0.190.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Add a hierarchical risk assessment system with Risk Assessment, Scope, Node (ENTITY / BOUNDARY / ASSET / DATA), Process, Threat, and Risk Scenario entities, and render a Mermaid data-flow diagram per scope (nodes typed by shape, threats attached as dashed edges)
- Add 13 access-review connector providers (with PKCE, token-body extras, and `AuthURL` templating support in the OAuth2 driver), and wire them through the review engine, the name worker, and the Helm chart
- Add a tracker mapping worker that resolves detected trackers to third parties using initiator domain extraction (eTLD+1), pattern-glob analysis, and a Firecrawl-backed LLM agent fallback for unmapped patterns
- Add a shared `common_third_parties` / `common_third_party_domains` catalog with slug-based deduplication, allow a single domain to be associated with multiple third parties, and auto-create entries from OCD imports
- Introduce the `proboctl` CLI (replaces the standalone `common-third-parties-import` and `common-tracker-patterns-import` commands as `proboctl seed ...`), with `data.json` embedded in the binary

### Changed

- Move the Firecrawl API key from the top-level config into `Agents.Tools`, hardcode the Firecrawl API endpoint (drop `FIRECRAWL_ENDPOINT`), and replace the SearXNG search backend with Firecrawl
- Split cookie names on both `_` and `-` separators so cookies like `__Secure-1PSID` no longer collapse into a bogus `___*` heuristic pattern

### Fixed

- Filter SCIM-deactivated (INACTIVE) people from signature request recipient lists in both the multi-select dialog and the document signatures page

### Removed

- Remove the deprecated snapshot system (the register/document model fully replaces it)
- Remove backend inactive-profile validation that incorrectly rejected newly-created users on first login

## [0.189.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- Rename `vendor` to `third party` across the API surface (GraphQL, MCP), database schema (migration), webhook event types (`vendor:*` → `third_party:*`), snapshot type (`VENDORS` → `THIRD_PARTIES`), and console / trust URL paths (breaking)
- Log `identity_id` on every authenticated request (cookie session, API key, OAuth2 access token) so operators can correlate a request back to its user and credential

## [0.188.0] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Derive cookie consent mode dynamically from the visitor's country and applicable regulation at consent-recording time; the `consent_mode` column is dropped from `cookie_banners` and persisted on `cookie_consent_records` instead, defaulting to `OPT_OUT` when no regulation matches (breaking)
- Capture `X-SDK-Version` via middleware and include it as `sdk_version` on all cookie banner request logs
- Use distinct badge colors per resource type and tracker type instead of only highlighting scripts

### Fixed

- Eliminate deadlocks when concurrent `ReportDetectedTrackers` calls update `tracker_patterns.last_matched_at` by replacing per-row updates with a single bulk update
- Stop generating bare `*` tracker patterns from separator-less cookie names; such names are kept as individual exact-match patterns for triage

### Removed

- Drop the legacy `cookies` and `cookie_patterns` tables (superseded by `tracker_patterns` and `detected_trackers`)

## [0.187.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Add a shared `common_third_parties` reference catalog, seeded from `packages/vendors/data.json` via a one-shot `common-third-parties-import` CLI, and back the `CreateVendorDialog` autocomplete with a new `commonThirdParties(name)` GraphQL query (server-side `ILIKE` search) instead of shipping the full vendor JSON bundle to the browser
- Self-host vendor logos in S3: at import time, fetch each site's HTML and pick the best icon (SVG, `apple-touch-icon`, large PNG, `msapplication-TileImage`) via the new `pkg/webinspect` package, then serve through the existing `/api/files/v1/{id}` endpoint instead of calling Google's favicon service per page load

### Changed

- Sanitize MCP error responses so internal details (stack traces, wrapped errors) are no longer leaked to clients

### Fixed

- Return a clean not-found error instead of a 500 when a membership lookup misses
- Upgrade `mermaid` to 11.15.0 to address GHSA-6m6c-36f7-fhxh (Gantt infinite-loop DoS), GHSA-xcj9-5m2h-648r and GHSA-87f9-hvmw-gh4p (CSS injection via `classDef`/configuration), and GHSA-ghcm-xqfw-q4vr (HTML injection via `classDef` in state diagrams)

## [0.186.1] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- Fix wrong entity types in `tracker_patterns` and `detected_trackers` GIDs: rows carried entity types of removed `CookiePatternEntityType` / `CookieEntityType` instead of `TrackerPatternEntityType` / `DetectedTrackerEntityType`

## [0.186.0] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Update kit package

## [0.185.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Add `TrackerResource` entity for detected scripts, iframes, images, beacons, fonts, fetches, media, and service workers, with full GraphQL, MCP, CLI, and frontend surface (list, view, create, update, delete, move-to-category); new "Resources" page under the cookie banner configuration tab
- Add `GLOB` match type for tracker patterns supporting prefix, suffix, and sandwich patterns (e.g. `ph_phc_*_posthog`), with duration-aware merging so trackers with materially different lifetimes are no longer collapsed into a single pattern
- Detect HTTP-header cookies via the Chromium `CookieStore` change event and expose a new `http` cookie source
- Add tracker-type filter and color-coded badges on the trackers page for quick visual scanning across Cookie / localStorage / sessionStorage / IndexedDB / Cache Storage
- Capture script initiator URL on detected trackers to enable per-vendor attribution for cookies and storage writes (column captured now, surfaced later)

### Changed

- Replace `PREFIX` tracker pattern match type with `GLOB` across GraphQL, MCP, and the frontend; existing `PREFIX` rows are migrated to `GLOB` with a trailing `*` (breaking)
- Make tracker pattern `displayName` read-only across GraphQL, MCP, and the frontend — it is now derived from pattern + match type (breaking)
- Pattern analysis worker now detects UUID-like, hash-like, and long numeric tokens as variable parts even from a single observation, so site-specific identifiers no longer get treated as static text
- Rename the cookie banner "Detection" page to "Trackers" and drop the `SCRIPT` / `IFRAME` tracker types (replaced by `TrackerResource`) (breaking)
- Agent runs now treat ctx cancellation as a graceful suspend signal: supervisor shutdown maps to run ctx cancellation, and the previous `WithStopSignal` API is removed (breaking for in-process callers)

### Fixed

- Fix empty country code being persisted on cookie consent records when IP geolocation returns no matching CIDR block
- Fix SQL corruption (HTTP 500 on `/report`) in `FindMatchingPattern` caused by `fmt.Sprintf` interpreting `%` characters in the LIKE escape clause
- Use `@deleteEdge` on the access review campaign delete mutation so the cached connection no longer surfaces a missing-data error when reopening the access reviews tab

## [0.184.2] - 2026-05-08

### Security

- Upgrade go to 1.26.3

## [0.184.1] - 2026-05-08

### Changed

- Microsoft 365 access review driver now fetches only internal members from Microsoft Graph (`$filter=userType eq 'Member'`), so guest (B2B) accounts are no longer pulled into access review
- SCIM settings page now hides the other IdP connector card once a bridge is connected; both remain listed when nothing is configured

### Fixed

- Fix cookie banner opt-out button opening the preference panel instead of performing a one-click reject in OPT_OUT regulations

## [0.184.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Allow editing approvers inline on SOA generated documents from the Statement of Applicability detail page (visible after first publish)

### Fixed

- Fix Microsoft 365 SCIM bridge: register the `MICROSOFT_365` connector provider, scope each Identity Provider card to its own bridge type so connecting one provider no longer marks others as connected, and filter Microsoft Graph users to home-tenant members (skip B2B guests)
- Fix cookie banner REST config endpoint compatibility for SDK versions ≤ 0.2.0
- Fix geolocation IP-to-country block imports

## [0.183.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Add IP-to-country geolocation service with shadow-table swap import and CIDR-based lookups
- Detect the visitor's privacy regulation (GDPR, UK GDPR, FADP, CCPA, PIPEDA, LGPD, LFPDPPP, POPIA, PDPA, PIPL, PIPA, APPI, DPDP, PDPL) on the cookie banner config endpoint and adapt the banner UI and texts accordingly (opt-out notice for CCPA, simple notice when no regulation applies)
- Store regulation and country code on cookie consent records and expose both across GraphQL, MCP, CLI, and n8n
- Allow deleting access review campaigns from the UI (DRAFT or CANCELLED only, gated on `core:access-review-campaign:delete`)
